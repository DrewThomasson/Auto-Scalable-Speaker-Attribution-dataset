# Auto-Scalable-Speaker-Attribution-dataset
This is my attempt at implementing a method for scaling speaker attribution datasets for literature by using GPT or any other capable LLM

For the first test I used a snippet from guardians of gahool in the ebooks folder, 
The results are a 98.3333% accuracy rating when using GPT4 for speaker attribution

I had to handlook through the each speaker attribution GPT4 assigned and had these reults in order of all 60 quotes found in the snippet from guardians of gahool:

:True means it was correct

:Fase means it was incorrect

:True/incorrect quotation means the quote wasnt nessisary a quote being said by a character but if you had to assign it to a characrter that would be the correct answer:

Results:

True
True/incorrect quotation
