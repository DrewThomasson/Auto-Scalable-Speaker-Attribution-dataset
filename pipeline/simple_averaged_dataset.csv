"“Oh,",19993,20010,True,654:A young Spotted Owl.?,"rescue’s coming in with two more little ones. Nest decimation.” Another Short- eared Owl flew by with a wad of something fluffy in her talons.“Oh, no! Poor little things.”“Nest decimation. What’s that?” Soren asked.“Accidental destruction of nests.” A young Spotted Owl flew up as they landed on a branch midway up the tree.“Otulissa, thank goodness. Can you show these new arrivals to that hollow we cleaned out yesterday?”“Certainly, Matron.”“And see if Cook has any tea or cakes left over. They look half starved.”“Certainly.” The Spotted Owl named Otulissa showed them to their hollow.“What is going on here?” Twilight asked her.“Oh, there’ve been some skirmishes up in the borderlands, nothing too serious.”“Is it St. Aggie’s?” Soren asked.“We know all about St. Aggie’s. Gylfie and I escaped.” Otulissa blinked.“And we killed their top two lieutenants when they came after Digger here. So we’re ready to fight,” Twilight added. The Spotted Owl blinked again.“I mean, we’re in the right place, aren’t we? The Great Ga’Hoole Tree?” Twilight had stepped closer to the owl to ask his question.“Where each night the order of knightly owls rises to perform noble deeds,” Soren offered in a softer voice. An uncertain feeling that was not quite a doubt, yet not a real belief, began to stir in Soren’s gizzard.“This is the place?” his voice",A young Spotted Owl

D’you reckon he could’ve beaten you and Dumbledore there?”“Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something,” said Harry.“Wouldn’t put it past him,” Ron muttered.“We need to see Professor Moody,” said Hermione.“We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch.”“If he had the Marauder’s Map on him, it would’ve been easy,” said Harry.“Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,” said Ron,“because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn’t—”“Shh!” said Hermione suddenly. Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry could hear two voices arguing, coming closer and closer.“— that’s blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that—”“— we’ve tried being polite; it’s time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn’t like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did—”“I’m telling you, if you put that in writing, it’s blackmail!”“Yeah, and you won’t be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will you?” The Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.“What’re you doing here?” Ron and Fred said at the same time.“Sending a letter,” said Harry and George in unison.“What, at this time?” said Hermione and Fred. Fred grinned.“Fine— we won’t",somebody
"plump rats,",5362,5434,True,142:Swatums.?,"“there is nothing simple. It’s just that it has been said that the Great Ga’Hoole Tree is invisible. That it grows on the island in the middle of a vast sea, a sea called Hoolemere that is nearly as wide as an ocean. A sea that is always wrapped in fog, an island feathered in blizzards, and a tree veiled in mist.”“So,” said Twilight,“it’s not really invisible, it’s just bad weather.”“Not exactly,” replied Swatums. Twilight cocked his head.“It seems that for some the fog lifts, the blizzards stop, and the mist blows away.”“For some?” asked Gylfie.“For those who believe.” Swatums paused and then sniffed in disdain.“But do they say what? Believe in what? No. You see, that is the problem. Owls with fancy ideas— ridiculous! That’s how you get into trouble. Sweetums and I don’t believe in fancy ideas. Fancy ideas don’t keep the belly full and the gizzard grinding. Sugar gliders, plump rats, voles— that’s what counts.” Sweetums nodded and Swatums went over and began preening her for the millionth time that day. Soren knew in that moment that even if he were starving to death, he would still find Sweetums and Swatums the most boring owls on Earth. That late afternoon as they nestled in the hollow, waiting for First Black, Gylfie stirred sleepily.“You awake, Soren?”“Yeah. I can’t wait to get to Hoolemere.”“Me, neither. But I was wondering,” Gylfie said.“Wondering what?”“Do you think that Streak and Zan love each other as much as Sweetums and Swatums?” Streak and Zan were two Bald Eagles who had helped them in the desert when Digger had been attacked by the lieutenants from St. Aggie’s— the very",Swatums

Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail’s right.“Lucius, my slippery friend,” he whispered, halting before him.“I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle- torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius.… Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay… but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?”“My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,” came Lucius Malfoy’s voice swiftly from beneath the hood.“Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me—”“And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?” said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly.“Yes, I know all about that, Lucius.… You have disappointed me.… I expect more faithful service in the future.”“Of course, my Lord, of course.… You are merciful, thank you.…” Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space— large enough for two people— that separated Malfoy and the next man.“The Lestranges should stand here,” said Voldemort quietly.“But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me.… When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges",Lucius Malfoy

Urgent message from the Ministry!” Harry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came clattering past with his robes on back- to- front and hurtled out of sight. When Harry and the others entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers—“I’ve got a quill here somewhere!”— and Mr. Weasley bending over the fire, talking to— Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly. Amos Diggory’s head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large, bearded egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears.“… Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went and called those what- d’you- call-’ems— please- men. Arthur, you’ve got to get over there—”“Here!” said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a piece of parchment, a bottle of ink, and a crumpled quill into Mr. Weasley’s hands.“— it’s a real stroke of luck I heard about it,” said Mr. Diggory’s head.“I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls, and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off— if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one, Arthur—”“What does Mad- Eye say happened?” asked Mr. Weasley, unscrewing the ink bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take notes.

but you caught it!,52871,52940,True,209:Martin.?,". It was as if every single one of his hollow bones, every feather shaft brimmed with this feeling of transcendent power. Joy filled him, a joy such as he had never felt since perhaps the first time he had ever flown. But how he got this coal was still a mystery to him. He flew back to the ridge where the buckets were. Martin was beside him.“You were spectacular, Soren. I was so nervous when I saw that crown fire break and then when we saw you getting sucked up, I nearly went yeep.”“But what happened?” Soren asked. They were to stay on the ridge until the rest of the chaw returned.“You mean to tell me you don’t know?”“Not exactly.”“You did a reverse loop to escape the pull and as you were coming out of it this coal flew by. Bubo said he never saw a coal of that size go up so high, but you caught it! Caught it on the loop, Soren. I mean it was better flying than anything Ruby has ever done. It was absolutely spectacular.”“Great Glaux, I wish I’d seen it,” Soren said. Martin hooted loudly.“You did it, Soren! You did it!” Otulissa flew in next with Ruby and Poot. She had a full beak and dumped the coals into the bucket.“I got one! I got one!” And then she stopped and looked up, genuinely modest now.“But, Soren, it is nothing compared to what you did.”“Well, thank you, Otulissa… er… uh… That is very kind of you.” Otulissa bobbed her head and actually said nothing for once. Martin blinked at Soren as if to say,“I wonder how long that will last?” Soren looked about for Ezylryb. He wondered if Ezyl",Martin

I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless. In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays. Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns.…” Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh— an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.“We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail.” Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse— with amusement. He was dangerous— a madman. And he was planning more murders— this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was— was in danger— Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village… but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.“One more murder… my faithful servant at Hogwarts…",the second man

They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living?“And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort… perhaps they now pay allegiance to another… perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?” At the mention of Dumbledore’s name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them.“It is a disappointment to me… I confess myself disappointed.…” One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort’s feet.“Master!” he shrieked,“Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!” Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.“Crucio!” The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around.… Let the police come, he thought desperately… anyone… anything… Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping.“Get up, Avery,” said Voldemort softly.“Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years… I want thirteen years’ repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?” He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob.“You returned to me, not out of loyalty",One of the men
"“Okay,”",131500,131503,True,268:Cho.F,"; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the dungeon door.“I’ll meet you at dinner,” he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off upstairs. He’d just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all.… He hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her, and(rather sooner than he had expected) he found her, emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.“Er— Cho? Could I have a word with you?” Giggling should be made illegal, Harry thought furiously, as all the girls around Cho started doing it. She didn’t, though. She said,“Okay,” and followed him out of earshot of her classmates. Harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs.“Er,” he said. He couldn’t ask her. He couldn’t. But he had to. Cho stood there looking puzzled, watching him. The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them.“Wangoballwime?”“Sorry?” said Cho.“D’you— d’you want to go to the ball with me?” said Harry. Why did he have to go red now? Why?“Oh!” said Cho, and she went red too.“Oh Harry, I’m really sorry,” and she truly looked it.“I’ve already",Cho
“Never!”,737,740,True,658:several people.?,"pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they had been most unpopular. Elderly Mr. and Mrs. Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown- up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer— for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night. The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders. They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles’ cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested.“Frank!” cried several people.“Never!” Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener. He lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since. There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.“Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn’t.”“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar,“he had a hard war, Frank.

See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably. A bunchy Barred Owl poked her head in.“Any tea here?”“Oh, yes, I think a cup of milkberry tea would be lovely.”“I dropped the egg. I don’t deserve to live.” Primrose emitted a long sound halfway between a whistle and a wail.“Don’t say that!” Soren exclaimed.“Of course you deserve to live. Every owl deserves to live. That’s why we came here.” Matron stopped what she was doing and cocked her head and regarded the young Barn Owl. Perhaps he was learning; just perhaps he was beginning to catch a glimmer of the true meaning of a noble deed. She would leave him to comfort this little Pygmy Owl and send in an extra cup of tea and some milkberry tart. Soren stayed with Primrose for the rest of the evening.

He took off his robes, pulled on the pajamas, and got into bed. Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs. Weasley, and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him. Ron and Hermione were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.“I’m all right,” he told them.“Just tired.” Mrs. Weasley’s eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bedcovers unnecessarily. Madam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office, returned holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a goblet.“You’ll need to drink all of this, Harry,” she said.“It’s a potion for dreamless sleep.” Harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls. He felt himself becoming drowsy at once. Everything around him became hazy; the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed; his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress. Before he could finish the potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep. Harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn’t open his eyes, wanting to drop off again. The room was still dimly lit; he was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he couldn’t have been asleep",Madam Pomfrey

Like most, this hollow had both an inside and an outside entrance so that one could either fly in or walk in from one of the many inner pathways through the trunk of the tree. He peeked in. He saw the Short- eared Owl called Matron who had led them to their own hollow. She was bustling about, plucking down from her own breast and tucking it in around an owl.“Now, now, dear, we know you did your best.”“But what will Mum and Da think?” For a moment Soren’s gizzard gave a lurch. Could this little owl be Eglantine?“They will think that you were a brave little Pygmy Owl,” Matron replied. Soren sighed.“What are you doing out there? Just don’t stand around, come in and make yourself useful,” Matron called. Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed.

You’ve done murder and you’re planning more! And I’ll tell you this too,” he added, on a sudden inspiration,“my wife knows I’m up here, and if I don’t come back—”“You have no wife,” said the cold voice, very quietly.“Nobody knows you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows… he always knows.…”“Is that right?” said Frank roughly.“Lord, is it?

I need some more worms over here, quick!” the nest- maid snake called out.“The Ga’Hoolology chaw is digging them as fast as they can,” another snake called.“Oh, my goodness, what a mess this little Sooty Owl is.” The snake nudged the last worm of her supply on the gash in the Sooty’s wing.“Poor little fellow. Now stop that babbling, dear. You don’t have enough energy.” But the owlet kept up a steady singsong about a world of Tyto purity and supremacy. There had never been such a flurry in the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. The infirmary was brimming with stunned and wounded owls. And no one was spared a moment’s rest. The owls of the tree were cutting back and forth between branches, flying in the new arrivals, rushing about getting fresh worms for their wounds, plucking down from their own breasts to make up new beds, bringing cup after cup of milkberry tea.

There were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster’s Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail’s head on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire. Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn’t believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he’d gotten through the first task, and he wouldn’t have to face the second one for three months.“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands.“Open it, Harry, go on!

Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open. It was hollow and completely empty— but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw.“Shut it!” Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again.“Sounded like a banshee.… Maybe you’ve got to get past one of those next, Harry!”“It was someone",several people
“Chaws— back up to your positions!”,19259,19268,True,172:Barran.F,"There were ledges that hung like galleries above. Soren, Twilight, Gylfie, and Digger gasped as they saw a great gathering of owls— all kinds of owls from Burrowing ones to Barn Owls, from Pygmy Owls to Elf Owls, from Screech Owls to Sooty Owls, from Great Horned Owls to Snowy Owls. Every kind of owl imaginable was here within the hollow of the great tree, their yellow, black, and amber eyes blinking and winking in the most friendly and inquisitive manner at the five new arrivals. Barran continued,“Welcome, young ones. Welcome to the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. One journey has ended…” Just one? thought Soren. But just then a series of deep, rolling gongs began to shake the entire tree. Barran stopped mid- speech.“Chaws— back up to your positions!” This hoot came from a Great Gray Owl in the gallery. Then, it seemed as if the entire hollow suddenly brightened as owls began donning battle claws and helmets, and the flames of the candles flickered off the bright polished surfaces of the armored owls.“Great Glaux— a battle! Quick, let’s get our claws!” Twilight began to hop up and down, pumping his wings.“Not so fast, young’un.” A plump, Short- eared Owl waddled up to them.“But where’s the battle?” Twilight said.“Beyond the Beyond.” The Short- eared Owl fixed him in the glow of her amber gaze.“And it’s not for you or you,” she said, turning to Gylfie,“or you",Barran
“What’s bonk?”,37073,37078,True,209:Martin.?,"coals from a new fire needed? Elvan turned to Bubo.“Bubo, as chief smith, would you care to answer that?”“Sure thing, mate.” Then he stepped up to Martin and, towering over him, began to speak.“A very good question. You are right, it is very possible to keep fires going forever and that is fine for some things— things like cooking and warming up a hollow. But for certain tasks, especially certain metalwork in the forge, we need new fresh coals that have been born of sparking trees full of sap. They become the blood of our hottest fires. Then again, we need a variety of coals. Certain coals from certain trees last longer. That’s how a fire gets bonk.”“What’s bonk?” asked Martin.“Ah, it’s an old smithy term. Hard to explain unless you’ve been working with the fires for some time. Then you know when you got a bonking good fire going in your forge. You know you got to look for the blue in the flame and then, this is the hardest, a tinge of green around the blue.” Soren was impressed. Being a blacksmith was truly a complicated business. Even though Bubo did not have the title of ryb, Soren thought he must be very smart. Soon, rest time was over, and they were told to begin marching without their coals to establish the rhythm again.“I simply can’t bear this a minute longer,” Otulissa said.“I think it’s going to be",Martin

Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron, and Hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast- Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn’t suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn’t seem to have mouths.“Ouch!” yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes.“It got me! Hagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.“Its end exploded!” said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid a burn on his hand.“Ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off,” said Hagrid, nodding.“Eurgh!” said Lavender Brown again.“Eurgh, Hagrid, what’s that pointy thing on it?”“Ah, some of’em have got stings,” said Hagrid enthusiastically(Lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box).“I reckon they’re the males.… The females’ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies.… I think they might be ter suck blood.”“Well, I can certainly see why we’re trying to keep them alive,” said Malfoy sarcastically.“Who wouldn’t want",Dean
That’s how you get into trouble.,5362,5434,True,142:Swatums.?,"“there is nothing simple. It’s just that it has been said that the Great Ga’Hoole Tree is invisible. That it grows on the island in the middle of a vast sea, a sea called Hoolemere that is nearly as wide as an ocean. A sea that is always wrapped in fog, an island feathered in blizzards, and a tree veiled in mist.”“So,” said Twilight,“it’s not really invisible, it’s just bad weather.”“Not exactly,” replied Swatums. Twilight cocked his head.“It seems that for some the fog lifts, the blizzards stop, and the mist blows away.”“For some?” asked Gylfie.“For those who believe.” Swatums paused and then sniffed in disdain.“But do they say what? Believe in what? No. You see, that is the problem. Owls with fancy ideas— ridiculous! That’s how you get into trouble. Sweetums and I don’t believe in fancy ideas. Fancy ideas don’t keep the belly full and the gizzard grinding. Sugar gliders, plump rats, voles— that’s what counts.” Sweetums nodded and Swatums went over and began preening her for the millionth time that day. Soren knew in that moment that even if he were starving to death, he would still find Sweetums and Swatums the most boring owls on Earth. That late afternoon as they nestled in the hollow, waiting for First Black, Gylfie stirred sleepily.“You awake, Soren?”“Yeah. I can’t wait to get to Hoolemere.”“Me, neither. But I was wondering,” Gylfie said.“Wondering what?”“Do you think that Streak and Zan love each other as much as Sweetums and Swatums?” Streak and Zan were two Bald Eagles who had helped them in the desert when Digger had been attacked by the lieutenants from St. Aggie’s— the very",Swatums

Never heard such a bunch of babble in my life.” It was Elsie, a rather bunchy- looking Barred Owl, who seemed to have more feathers than her small body could manage. The bar designs on her wings had almost faded into a blur. But she was a kindly old bird, who, along with Matron, was in charge of the care and feeding of all the newly arrived young owlets at the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. Never before had the two owls been actually brought out to a gathering station on a search- and- rescue mission, however.“Over here, Twilight,” Matron called.“I have just fluffed up a place. That Sooty will fit in nicely. Elsie dear, spare me a bit more down for this Sooty.” Elsie obliged by plucking out some downy fluff from beneath her primaries. Twilight blinked. It was just as Elsie said. A low babble came in a steady stream from the little owlets, and they were all reciting some kind of poetry, and it made absolutely no sense to Twilight. One little Grass Owl was now chanting in a thin little voice,“Tytos now forever, so pure, so rare! Yet supreme!” A Masked Owl spoke of a Tyto to whom righteousness belonged and still another was crying out,“Oh, Tyto, who is pureness beyond compare, show thyself… Tyto, how long shall the impure triumph?”“Depressing little ditties, aren’t they?” Bubo said as he lighted down next to Twilight.“What are they talking",Matron

His talons!” She paused.“Or lack of!” The Whiskered Screech, indeed, had only three talons on one foot. And just as Soren was blinking in a mixture of astonishment and horror, the old owl swung his head about and fixed Soren in his squinted gaze. Soren thought his gizzard was going to drop right out of him.“So, Elvanryb,” Boron turned and addressed another owl, a Great Gray.“It is your notion that we need to have a search- and- rescue attachment chaw on the colliering missions?”“Not all, Boron.

Can you show these new arrivals to that hollow we cleaned out yesterday?”“Certainly, Matron.”“And see if Cook has any tea or cakes left over. They look half starved.”“Certainly.” The Spotted Owl named Otulissa showed them to their hollow.“What is going on here?” Twilight asked her.“Oh, there’ve been some skirmishes up in the borderlands, nothing too serious.”“Is it St. Aggie’s?” Soren asked.“We know all about St. Aggie’s. Gylfie and I escaped.” Otulissa blinked.“And we killed their top two lieutenants when they came after Digger here. So we’re ready to fight,” Twilight added.

Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy’s voice spoke from under the mask.“Master, we crave to know… we beg you to tell us… how you have achieved this… this miracle… how you managed to return to us.…”“Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,” said Voldemort.“And it begins— and ends— with my young friend here.” He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle.“You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?” Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony.“You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him.

Soren stole a glance at her. There was pure venom in her eyes. Why couldn’t she just be angry about being in this chaw? What did Bubo have to do with it? Soren thought. He knew why, of course. Otulissa thought she was too good to have anything to do with Bubo. Neither Bubo nor any of the owls in this chaw had the distinguished background of Otulissa. It was an outrage, as she told Soren forty times a night, that she had not been included in Strix Struma’s navigation chaw. Elvan continued speaking during their break.“And then, of course, after you have had enough nights of weather training we shall find a nice forest fire for you— nothing too big, mind you. Just a nice little beginning fire with a good mix of trees— Ga’Hooles, firs, pine, some soft and hard woods. Not too many ridges or mountains to complicate wind patterns.”“Pardon me,” piped up the little Northern Saw- whet Owl, Martin, who had been rescued the same night as Primrose.“Yes, Martin,” Elvan said.“Well, I don’t understand why we need new coals all the time. Once you start a fire going, wouldn’t there always be new coals?” This was some smart little owl, Soren thought. Why hadn’t the others thought of this question? Why were new coals from a new fire needed? Elvan turned to Bubo.“Bubo, as chief smith, would you care to answer that?”“Sure thing, mate.” Then he stepped up to Martin and, towering over him, began to speak.“A very good question. You are right",Elvan
"“First,",52128,52134,True,205:Elvan.?,"them. He must keep his focus on Martin, who was now just a little smudge on the ground. A cloud of smoke temporarily obscured him and Soren flew lower. There he was! There he was! Good heavens, he was coming up fast!“He’s coming in loaded!” Bubo slid in next to Elvan. And then he was there. Cinders poured from his small beak. His face was sooty and smudged but his eyes danced with a light as bright as the fire.“I did it! I did it!”“You certainly did, young’un.” Bubo flew up and tousled Martin’s head feathers with his talon.“I can’t wait to go back,” Martin shouted.“Hold on there,” Elvan said.“First, your report.”“Embers about the size of pellets uphill from where I landed.”“Excellent,” Elvan said. Elvan then flew off to confer with Bubo and Ezylryb.“Soren, there is nothing like it. I can’t tell you. As soon as I got there I just wasn’t frightened at all. And I can’t describe what it’s like to grab the cinders in your beak. It’s…”“Intoxicating,” Otulissa broke in.“Yes, I read about it. You must be careful, though.

Could this little owl be Eglantine?“They will think that you were a brave little Pygmy Owl,” Matron replied. Soren sighed.“What are you doing out there? Just don’t stand around, come in and make yourself useful,” Matron called. Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably.

The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan can not proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.” Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word“Quidditch,” which was not a word at all.“The— the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said Wormtail.(Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.)“Forgive me, but— I do not understand— why should we wait until the World Cup is over?”“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, checking and double- checking identities.

He had distinctly heard the words“Ministry of Magic,”“wizards,” and“Muggles.” Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of menace in the cold voice now.

By forcing them to sleep during the full shines of the moon, directly exposing their heads to the moon’s light, they destroyed the will, the very personalities of individual owls and made them perfectly obedient with no thoughts of their own. Soren and Gylfie had devised a plan for fooling the sleep monitors and escaping the full shine. It turned out so had Hortense. She, in fact, was an infiltrator and had been sneaking out the eggs that St. Aggie’s patrols had been snatching. Unfortunately, however, she was caught and killed. Still, they had heard that Hortense had become a legend in Ambala because of her heroic deeds.“Yes,” another owl was speaking now.“The egg production is down, and it is thought to be caused by a blight on the rodent population.

Nest decimation.” Another Short- eared Owl flew by with a wad of something fluffy in her talons.“Oh, no! Poor little things.”“Nest decimation. What’s that?” Soren asked.“Accidental destruction of nests.” A young Spotted Owl flew up as they landed on a branch midway up the tree.“Otulissa, thank goodness. Can you show these new arrivals to that hollow we cleaned out yesterday?”“Certainly, Matron.”“And see if Cook has any tea or cakes left over. They look half starved.”“Certainly.” The Spotted Owl named Otulissa showed them to their hollow.“What is going on here?” Twilight asked her.“Oh, there’ve been some skirmishes up in the borderlands, nothing too serious.”“Is it St. Aggie’s?” Soren asked.“We know all about St. Aggie’s. Gylfie and I escaped.” Otulissa blinked.“And we killed their top two lieutenants when they came after Digger here. So we’re ready to fight,” Twilight added. The Spotted Owl blinked again.“I mean, we’re in the right place, aren’t we? The Great Ga’Hoole Tree?” Twilight had stepped closer to the owl to ask his question.“Where each night the order of knightly owls rises to perform noble deeds,” Soren offered in a softer voice. An uncertain feeling that was not quite a doubt, yet not a real belief, began to stir in Soren’s gizzard.“This is the place?” his voice",A young Spotted Owl

Soren stole a glance at her. There was pure venom in her eyes. Why couldn’t she just be angry about being in this chaw? What did Bubo have to do with it? Soren thought. He knew why, of course. Otulissa thought she was too good to have anything to do with Bubo. Neither Bubo nor any of the owls in this chaw had the distinguished background of Otulissa. It was an outrage, as she told Soren forty times a night, that she had not been included in Strix Struma’s navigation chaw. Elvan continued speaking during their break.“And then, of course, after you have had enough nights of weather training we shall find a nice forest fire for you— nothing too big, mind you. Just a nice little beginning fire with a good mix of trees— Ga’Hooles, firs, pine, some soft and hard woods. Not too many ridges or mountains to complicate wind patterns.”“Pardon me,” piped up the little Northern Saw- whet Owl, Martin, who had been rescued the same night as Primrose.“Yes, Martin,” Elvan said.“Well, I don’t understand why we need new coals all the time. Once you start a fire going, wouldn’t there always be new coals?” This was some smart little owl, Soren thought. Why hadn’t the others thought of this question? Why were new coals from a new fire needed? Elvan turned to Bubo.“Bubo, as chief smith, would you care to answer that?”“Sure thing, mate.” Then he stepped up to Martin and, towering over him, began to speak.“A very good question.

Harry heard people gasping, screaming, and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them, taking him back to the castle. Across the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship, Harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk.“What happened, Harry?” the man asked at last as he lifted Harry up the stone steps. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. It was Mad- Eye Moody.“Cup was a Portkey,” said Harry as they crossed the entrance hall.“Took me and Cedric to a graveyard… and Voldemort was there… Lord Voldemort…” Clunk.

Within the depths of the impenetrable white, Twilight saw two even whiter patches.“Come, young’uns. You’re right over the current. Can’t tell it on a night like this, though. So, welcome to the Island of Hoole.” Two giant Snowy Owls had melted out from the night and they were so white that by comparison the mist seemed gray.“I am Boron and this is my mate, Barran.”“You are the king and the queen of Hoole.” Twilight whispered. Digger and Gylfie, exhausted, plummeted down near them.“Yes, my dears. But we prefer to be called teachers, or rybs. The word ryb means teacher and deep knowledge,” said Barran.“We’re not keen on titles,” chuckled Boron.“But you came out to meet us?” said Soren.“Of course,” replied Boron.“You’ve done the hard part. Now let us guide you the rest of the way. It’s not far.” The blizzard had been swallowed by the mist and the mist now seemed to melt away against the whiteness of Boron and Barran. The night turned black again and the stars broke out. As a half moon rose, the four young owls looked below and saw the vast sea glinting with silver spangles from the moonlight and then, directly ahead, spreading into the night, were the twisting branches of the largest tree they had ever seen, the Great Ga’Hoole Tree.“",Barran

Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered.“I told you… it was an accident.…”“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back.“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman… but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh?

Silence!” Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling. Then the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.“I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you, and I will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few more months will make no difference. As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will be effective. All that is needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail— courage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldemort’s wrath—”“My Lord, I must speak!” said Wormtail, panic in his voice now.“All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head— My Lord, Bertha Jorkins’s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if I murder—”“If?” whispered the second voice.“If? If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died.

Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky. For a few minutes, the silence was broken only by Madame Maxime’s huge horses snorting and stamping. But then—“Can you hear something?” said Ron suddenly. Harry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness: a muffled rumbling and sucking sound, as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed.…“The lake!” yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it.“Look at the lake!” From their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water— except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all. Some disturbance was taking place deep in the center; great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing over the muddy banks— and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared, as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake’s floor.… What seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpool… and then Harry saw the rigging.…“It’s a mast!”",Lee Jordan

A power thrust was required to get over them. Soren banked and followed the veteran owl, Poot. Martin was in between the two. The tiny owl would get a boost from Poot’s speed, as a vacuum would be created, through which he could be sucked up and over the baggywrinkles right into the gutter. Ruby was just ahead of him. She let escape a small joyous hoot. And then, suddenly, Soren knew why. Here, at the center of the gale, in the gutter, the winds all seemed to flow like one great turbulent river.

He took off his robes, pulled on the pajamas, and got into bed. Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs. Weasley, and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him. Ron and Hermione were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.“I’m all right,” he told them.“Just tired.” Mrs. Weasley’s eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bedcovers unnecessarily. Madam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office, returned holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a goblet.“You’ll need to drink all of this, Harry,” she said.“It’s a potion for dreamless sleep.” Harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls. He felt himself becoming drowsy at once. Everything around him became hazy; the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed; his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress. Before he could finish the potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep. Harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn’t open his eyes, wanting to drop off again.

This was the most distinctive feature of Barn Owls, and he really did not want to think of it growing singed and sooty. Maybe he was vain but he couldn’t help it.“Pay attention!

Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon. They said good- bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door. A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents.

Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure that Frank had invented him.

"“The egg production is down,",23421,23448,True,710:another owl.F,"Moon blinking was perhaps the cruelest thing that St. Aggie’s did to young owls. By forcing them to sleep during the full shines of the moon, directly exposing their heads to the moon’s light, they destroyed the will, the very personalities of individual owls and made them perfectly obedient with no thoughts of their own. Soren and Gylfie had devised a plan for fooling the sleep monitors and escaping the full shine. It turned out so had Hortense. She, in fact, was an infiltrator and had been sneaking out the eggs that St. Aggie’s patrols had been snatching. Unfortunately, however, she was caught and killed. Still, they had heard that Hortense had become a legend in Ambala because of her heroic deeds.“Yes,” another owl was speaking now.“The egg production is down, and it is thought to be caused by a blight on the rodent population. Simply not enough food.” Soren and Gylfie exchanged looks. It was not just the rodent population. It was the St. Aggie’s egg snatchers. This was information they could offer. This might convince Boron and Barran that they really knew something.“We’ll look into it,” Boron said.“And now, I believe some of our new arrivals have requested to speak with us.” He turned and blinked at the four young owls. Speak with us! What was he talking about? Soren was not prepared to talk in front of all these owls.“Now who wants to go first?” Twilight, Digger, and Gylfie all looked at Soren.“Up here, young’un.” There was a perch in the middle of the half circle to which Boron nodded.

More publicity.”“Good luck!” said Colin when they had reached the right room. Harry knocked on the door and entered. He was in a fairly small classroom; most of the desks had been pushed away to the back of the room, leaving a large space in the middle; three of them, however, had been placed end- to- end in front of the blackboard and covered with a long length of velvet. Five chairs had been set behind the velvet- covered desks, and Ludo Bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch Harry had never seen before, who was wearing magenta robes. Viktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not talking to anybody. Cedric and Fleur were in conversation. Fleur looked a good deal happier than Harry had seen her so",Colin

And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright. Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long.

There were many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts; it was second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step, but Neville’s memory was notoriously poor.

All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer— for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night. The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders. They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles’ cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested.“Frank!” cried several people.“Never!” Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener. He lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since. There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.“Unfriendly, like.

There is nothing that noble about slaughtering two bad owls in the desert.” The Spotted Owl rose up to her full height and looked down her beak at Gylfie. In a very haughty voice she said,“You have not been tempered by battle yet. Nor do you know the first thing about strategy. You probably don’t even know how to fly with battle claws. I have been here much longer than you and still have not yet become a member of a chaw.”“What’s a chaw?” Soren said.“You are selected to join a chaw— a small team of owls— and you will learn a skill that is helpful.”“In battle?” Twilight asked.“Not just battle— in life. There is more to life than just battles. Each chaw has its own, oh, how should I put it? Personality. Navigation chaw tends to have a kind of elegance, they are all superb flyers, as are the members of search- and- rescue, but they, of course, are less refined. Weather interpretation and colliering are decidely rough and uncouth. But,” and the Spotted Owl fixed a very intense gaze on Twilight,“they are all fiercely brave and can fight or fly to the death!” Twilight seemed to swell in anticipation, but Soren almost shrank with fear. Would he be up to it? He had to be. With his friends, he could. Look what they had accomplished so far!“Do we all get to be in the same chaw?” Soren asked.“Probably not.”“But we’re a band.” Soren hoped that he did not sound as if he were pleading.“That doesn’t matter now. You’re part of a larger band. I have to go.”“Duty calls, I suppose,” Gylfie said with a slight edge in her voice.",the Spotted Owl

But Madame Maxime had already put her arm around Fleur’s shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room. Harry could hear them both talking very fast in French as they went off into the Great Hall. Karkaroff beckoned to Krum, and they, too, exited, though in silence.“Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,” said Dumbledore, smiling at both of them.“I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you, and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise.” Harry glanced at Cedric, who nodded,",Crouch

One, too cowardly to return… he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever… he will be killed, of course… and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.” The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks.“He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight.…“Yes,” said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry’s direction.“Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.” There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy’s voice spoke from under the mask.“Master, we crave to know… we beg you to tell us… how you have achieved this… this miracle… how you managed to return to us.…”“Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,” said Voldemort.“And it begins— and ends— with my young friend here.” He walked lazily over to stand",the Death Eaters

He did notice, however, that Elvan’s fringe of light feathers below his beak seemed to be a permanently sooty gray. Soren thought of his own face, covered in pure white feathers. This was the most distinctive feature of Barn Owls, and he really did not want to think of it growing singed and sooty. Maybe he was vain but he couldn’t help it.“Pay attention! Soren!” Elvan barked.“You nearly ran into Otulissa.” Thank Glaux she couldn’t speak, thought Soren. That was the only good thing about colliering. It was hard to speak with a live coal in one’s mouth. So Otulissa was effectively shut up for once.“All right, rest time. Drop your coals,” Elvan announced. Rest wasn’t really rest, however, as the ryb lectured them the entire time.“Tomorrow you shall begin flying with the coals in your beaks. It is not that different, really, from walking. Although you must take care to keep your coal alive and burning.”“Yeah!” Bubo boomed.“Dead coals ain’t going to do me a bit of good, young’uns. No sense flying in here with a great lot of ashes, cold as Glaux knows what.”“Yes,” continued Elvan.“We don’t want to disappoint Bubo.”“Oh, Glaux forbid that we should disappoint Bubo,” Otulissa mumbled.

As Harry and Ron left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle. Pansy Parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of Slytherin girls. Catching sight of Harry, Pansy called,“Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend? Why was she so upset at breakfast?” Harry ignored her; he didn’t want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused. Hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns, was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet. Harry’s heart sank at the sight of the crates— surely not another skrewt hatching?— but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number of fluffy black creatures with long snouts. Their front paws were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention.“These’re nifflers,” said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around.“Yeh find’em down mines",Pansy Parkinson

Hands still clamped over his buttocks, he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen. Harry hurried into the living room. Loud hangings and scrapings were coming from behind the Dursleys’ boarded- up fireplace, which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it.“What is it?” gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall and was staring, terrified, toward the fire.“What is it, Vernon?” But they were left in doubt barely a second longer.

Before he could finish the potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep. Harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn’t open his eyes, wanting to drop off again. The room was still dimly lit; he was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he couldn’t have been asleep very long.

A bunchy Barred Owl poked her head in.“Any tea here?”“Oh, yes, I think a cup of milkberry tea would be lovely.”“I dropped the egg. I don’t deserve to live.” Primrose emitted a long sound halfway between a whistle and a wail.“Don’t say that!” Soren exclaimed.“Of course you deserve to live. Every owl deserves to live. That’s why we came here.” Matron stopped what she was doing and cocked her head and regarded the young Barn Owl. Perhaps he was learning; just perhaps he was beginning to catch a glimmer of the true meaning of a noble deed. She would leave him to comfort this little Pygmy Owl and",the little owl

Professor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical eye was dancing in its socket.“Nice and easy does the trick, Potter,” he growled.“Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please…” said Professor McGonagall. Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking worried.“Dragons!” she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside. The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric’s shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry’s shoulder, talking furiously all the while.“Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next? You’re very lucky… this is quite shallow… it’ll need cleaning before I heal it up, though.…” She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.“Now, just sit quietly for a minute— sit! And then you can go and get your score.” She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say,“How does it feel now, Diggory?” Harry didn’t want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline. He got to his feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he’d reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside— Hermione, followed closely by Ron.“Harry, you were brilliant!” Hermione said squeakily.

Neville looked around.“Oh hello,” he said, his voice much higher than usual.“Interesting lesson, wasn’t it? I wonder what’s for dinner, I’m— I’m starving, aren’t you?”“Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.“Oh yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice.“Very interesting dinner— I mean lesson— what’s for eating?” Ron gave Harry a startled look.“Neville, what—?” But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them.

Ours are rather meek, I guess, compared to this… What do you call her?”“Her name is Mrs. Plithiver,” Soren said slowly and distinctly with the contempt in his voice poorly concealed.“Yes, yes,” the female replied nervously.“Well, we discourage our nest- maids from socially mingling with us at any time, really.”“That was hardly a party, what happened up there in the sky, ma’am,” Twilight said hotly.“Well, now tell me, young’uns,” said the male as if he was desperately trying to change the subject.“Where are you heading?

Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man, dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie. The parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight, and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule. His shoes were very highly polished. Harry could see at once why Percy idolized him. Percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules, and Mr. Crouch had complied with the rule about Muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager; Harry doubted even Uncle Vernon would have spotted him for what he really was.“Pull up a bit of grass, Barty,” said Ludo brightly, patting the ground beside him.“No thank you, Ludo,” said Crouch, and there was a bite of impatience in his voice.“I’ve been looking for you everywhere. The Bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the Top Box.”“Oh is that what they’re after?” said Bagman.“I thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers. Bit of a strong accent.”“Mr. Crouch!” said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a kind of half- bow that made him look like a hunchback.“Would you like a cup of tea?”“Oh,” said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild surprise.“Yes— thank you, Weatherby” Fred and George choked into their own cups.

It had to be scary.“Don’t worry, Martin. You’re going to be all right.”“Soren, that’s kind of you, but do you realize that I am the first Saw- whet to ever be in the colliering chaw?”“They must think you’re special, Martin,” Soren said.“But what if I’m not?” Martin said, a squeak of desperation creeping into his voice.

It had the body of an over- large lion: great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman. She turned her long, almond- shaped eyes upon Harry as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress. Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.“You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.”“So… so will you move, please?” said Harry, knowing what the answer was going to be.“No,” she said, continuing to pace.“Not unless you can answer my riddle. Answer on your first guess— I let you pass. Answer wrongly— I attack. Remain silent— I will let you walk away from me unscathed.” Harry’s stomach slipped several notches. It was Hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he could keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative route to the center.“Okay,” he said.“Can I hear the riddle?” The sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of the path, and recited:“First think of the person who lives in disguise, Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.

The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan can not proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.” Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word“Quidditch,” which was not a word at all.“The— the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said Wormtail.(Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.)“Forgive me, but— I do not understand— why should we wait until the World Cup is over?”“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, checking and double- checking identities. They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait.” Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words“Ministry of Magic,”“wizards,” and“Muggles.” Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of menace in the cold voice now. A slight pause followed— and then Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.“It could be",Frank

Now, you don’t want to do that, young’uns.” Poot was a Boreal Owl like Soren and Gylfie’s old friend Grimble.“What happens if you get caught in the rim of the eye of a hurricane?” asked Rudy.“Oh, you spin around till you’re dead. Just around and around and around. Awful nasty way to go. Usually get your wings torn off in the process,” said Poot.“Now, don’t go scaring them, Poot,” Octavia said and gave a ripple so that all their plates clattered a bit.“And please, young’uns, don’t try that trick of slipping the fur under the table. Remember, I am the table and it itches something fierce.” It was not even dark yet, but the weather chaw owls were already on the takeoff limb",Poot

Within the depths of the impenetrable white, Twilight saw two even whiter patches.“Come, young’uns. You’re right over the current. Can’t tell it on a night like this, though. So, welcome to the Island of Hoole.” Two giant Snowy Owls had melted out from the night and they were so white that by comparison the mist seemed gray.“I am Boron and this is my mate, Barran.”“You are the king and the queen of Hoole.” Twilight whispered. Digger and Gylfie, exhausted, plummeted down near them.“Yes, my dears. But we prefer to be called teachers, or rybs. The word ryb means teacher and deep knowledge,” said Barran.“We’re not keen on titles,” chuckled Boron.“But you came out to meet us?” said Soren.“Of course,” replied Boron.“You’ve done the hard part. Now let us guide you the rest of the way. It’s not far.” The blizzard had been swallowed by the mist and the mist now seemed to melt away against the whiteness of Boron and Barran. The night turned black again and the stars broke out. As a half moon rose, the four young owls looked below and saw the vast sea glinting with silver spangles from the moonlight and then, directly ahead, spreading into the night, were the twisting branches of the largest tree they had ever seen, the Great Ga’Hoole Tree.“",Barran

Meanwhile Madame Maxime was trying to restrain Fleur Delacour, who was quite hysterical, fighting tooth and nail to return to the water.“Gabrielle! Gabrielle! Is she alive? Is she’ urt?”“She’s fine!” Harry tried to tell her, but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk, let alone shout. Percy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the bank(“Gerroff, Percy, I’m all right!”); Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.“It was ze grindylows… zey attacked me… oh Gabrielle, I thought… I thought…”“Come here, you,” said Madam Pomfrey. She seized Harry and pulled him over to Hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat. Steam gushed out of his ears.“Harry, well done!” Hermione cried.“You did it, you found out how all by yourself!”“Well—” said Harry. He would have told her about Dobby, but he had just noticed Karkaroff watching him. He was the only judge who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur’s sister had got back safely.“Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry, raising",Madam Pomfrey
Granger!”,170049,170062,True,453:Pansy Parkinson.F,"approached the final lesson of the afternoon— double Potions— feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson’s gang of Slytherin girls. All of them were looking at something Harry couldn’t see and sniggering heartily. Pansy’s pug- like face peered excitedly around Goyle’s broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached.“There they are, there they are!” she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands— Witch Weekly. The moving picture on the front showed a curly- haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.“You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!” Pansy said loudly, and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking startled. At that moment, the dungeon door opened, and Snape beckoned them all inside. Hermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual. Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of today’s potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk. At last, in the center pages, Hermione found what they were looking for. Harry and Ron leaned in closer. A color photograph of Harry headed a short piece entitled: Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache A boy like no other, perhaps— yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence, writes Rita Skeeter.

It was as if every single one of his hollow bones, every feather shaft brimmed with this feeling of transcendent power. Joy filled him, a joy such as he had never felt since perhaps the first time he had ever flown. But how he got this coal was still a mystery to him. He flew back to the ridge where the buckets were. Martin was beside him.“You were spectacular, Soren. I was so nervous when I saw that crown fire break and then when we saw you getting sucked up, I nearly went yeep.”“But what happened?” Soren asked. They were to stay on the ridge until the rest of the chaw returned.“You mean to tell me you don’t know?”“Not exactly.”“You did a reverse loop to escape the pull and as you were coming out of it this coal flew by. Bubo said he never saw a coal of that size go up so high, but you caught it! Caught it on the loop, Soren. I mean it was better flying than anything Ruby has ever done. It was absolutely spectacular.”“Great Glaux, I wish I’d seen it,” Soren said. Martin hooted loudly.“You did it, Soren! You did it!” Otulissa flew in next with Ruby and Poot. She had a full beak and dumped the coals into the bucket.“I got one! I got one!” And then she stopped and looked up, genuinely modest now.“But, Soren, it is nothing compared to what you did.”“Well, thank you, Otulissa… er… uh… That is very kind of you.” Otulissa bobbed her head and actually said nothing for once. Martin blinked at Soren as if to say,“I wonder how long that will last?” Soren looked about for Ezylryb. He wondered if Ezyl",Martin

They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me.… When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us… they are our natural allies… we will recall the banished giants… I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear.…” He walked on.

Was Hagrid in there, alone and ill?“What’s wrong with Hagrid?” Harry said, hurrying to catch up with Professor Grubbly- Plank.“Never you mind,” she said as though she thought he was being nosy.“I do mind, though,” said Harry hotly.“What’s up with him?” Professor Grubbly- Plank acted as though she couldn’t hear him. She led them past the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses were standing, huddled against the cold, and toward a tree on the edge of the forest, where a large and beautiful unicorn was tethered. Many of the girls“ooooohed!” at the sight of the unicorn.“Oh it’s so beautiful!” whispered Lavender Brown.“How did she get it? They’re supposed to be really hard to catch!” The unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look gray. It was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its horned head.“Boys keep back!” barked Professor Grubbly- Plank, throwing out an arm and catching Harry hard in the chest.“They prefer the woman’s touch, unicorns. Girls to the front, and approach with care, come on, easy does it.…” She and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn, leaving the boys standing near the paddock fence, watching. The moment Professor Grubbly- Plank was out of earshot, Harry turned to Ron.“What d’you reckon’s wrong with him? You don’t think a skrewt—?”“Oh he hasn’t been attacked, Potter",Lavender Brown

Harry heard people gasping, screaming, and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them, taking him back to the castle. Across the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship, Harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk.“What happened, Harry?” the man asked at last as he lifted Harry up the stone steps.

He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high- ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing,“Harry Potter, sir! Harry Potter!” Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.“D- Dobby?” Harry gasped.“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel.“Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!” Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis- ball- shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil- shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and feet— all except the clothes, which were very different. When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on which he had pinned a number of bright badges; a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest",the squealing elf

He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there.“And here we have six missing Death Eaters… three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return… he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever… he will be killed, of course… and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.” The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks.“He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight.…“Yes,” said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry’s direction.“Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.” There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy’s voice spoke from under the mask.“Master, we crave to know… we beg you to tell us… how you have achieved this… this miracle… how you managed to return to us.…”“Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,” said Voldemort.“And it begins— and ends— with my young friend here.” He walked lazily over to stand",the Death Eaters

Harry was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly- Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.“I hope she stays, that woman!” said Parvati Patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch.“That’s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like… proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters.…”“What about Hagrid?” Harry said angrily as they went up the steps.“What about him?” said Parvati in a hard voice.“He can still be gamekeeper, can’t he?” Parvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good time all the same. She was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the next weekend trip.“That was a really good lesson,” said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall.“I didn’t know half the things Professor Grubbly- Plank told us about uni—”“Look at this!” Harry snarled",Parvati

Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open. It was hollow and completely empty— but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw.“Shut it!” Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again.“Sounded like a banshee.… Maybe you’ve got to get past one of those next, Harry!”“It was someone",several people

Down below, it appeared that the female was trying to run across the surface of the water while madly flapping her wings.“Water takeoff— not easy for any of us. We’re not the best fliers, but, as you can see, we can dive. Got these little air pockets so we can go really deep for a long, long time. Getting back to the nest is the hardest part for us.” The male stepped out of the ice hollow and called down.“Dearest, try that patch over there under the lee, the water is smoother.” She gave her mate a withering glance, and somehow through the mouthful of fish yelled back,“You want me to fly directly into the wall, Puff Head! There’s a tailwind. I’ll slam beak- first into it. Then where will your dinner be? If you’re so smart you come down and go fishing yourself.”“Oh, sorry, dear, silly me.” Then he turned to the owls.“We’re really not that bright. I mean we dive well, know how to fish, and deal with ice, but that’s about it.” But, in fact, the puffins knew more and were not that dumb at all.“Just low self- esteem,” Gylfie said. The puffins, in addition to knowing how to dive and fish, knew weather. And just now they were telling them that there would be a small pocket of time when the wind would turn, and they could leave before the next storm came in.“You see, young’uns,” said the male puffin,“nine days out often, the wind slams full force up",the female

There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven o’clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom of her picture.“Lairy fights, that’s the one!” she giggled when they gave the password, and she swung forward to let them inside. Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very self- conscious, but none as much as Ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face. There was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly well; at least he was now lace- free, although he hadn’t done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs",the Fat Lady

I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless. In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays. Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns.…” Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh— an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.“We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail.” Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse— with amusement. He was dangerous— a madman. And he was planning more murders— this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was— was in danger— Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village… but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.“One more murder… my faithful servant at Hogwarts…",the second man

He chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling.“Very well, very well,” Snape snapped.“Potter, leave your things here, I want you back down here later to test your antidote.”“Please, sir— he’s got to take his things with him,” squeaked Colin.“All the champions—”“Very well!” said Snape.“Potter— take your bag and get out of my sight!” Harry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for the door. As he walked through the Slytherin desks, POTTER STINKS flashed at him from every direction.“It’s amazing, isn’t it, Harry?” said Colin, starting to speak the moment Harry had closed the dungeon door behind him.“Isn’t it, though? You being champion?”“Yeah, really amazing,” said Harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into the entrance hall.“What do they want photos for, Colin?”“The Daily Prophet, I think!”“Great",Colin

Never heard such a bunch of babble in my life.” It was Elsie, a rather bunchy- looking Barred Owl, who seemed to have more feathers than her small body could manage. The bar designs on her wings had almost faded into a blur. But she was a kindly old bird, who, along with Matron, was in charge of the care and feeding of all the newly arrived young owlets at the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. Never before had the two owls been actually brought out to a gathering station on a search- and- rescue mission, however.“Over here, Twilight,” Matron called.“I have just fluffed up a place. That Sooty will fit in nicely. Elsie dear, spare me a bit more down for this Sooty.” Elsie obliged by plucking out some downy fluff from beneath her primaries. Twilight blinked. It was just as Elsie said. A low babble came in a steady stream from the little owlets, and they were all reciting some kind of poetry, and it made absolutely no sense to Twilight. One little Grass Owl was now chanting in a thin little voice,“Tytos now forever, so pure, so rare! Yet supreme!” A Masked Owl spoke of a Tyto to whom righteousness belonged and still another was crying out,“Oh, Tyto, who is pureness beyond compare, show thyself… Tyto,",Matron

Professor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical eye was dancing in its socket.“Nice and easy does the trick, Potter,” he growled.“Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please…” said Professor McGonagall. Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking worried.“Dragons!” she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside. The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric’s shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry’s shoulder, talking furiously all the while.“Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next? You’re very lucky… this is quite shallow… it’ll need cleaning before I heal it up, though.…” She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.“Now, just sit quietly for a minute— sit!

Harry Potter has to go into the lake and find his Wheezy—”“Find my what?”“— and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople!”“What’s a Wheezy?”“Your Wheezy, sir, your Wheezy— Wheezy who is giving Dobby his sweater!” Dobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now wearing over his shorts.“What?” Harry gasped.“They’ve got… they’ve got Ron?”“The thing Harry Potter will miss most, sir!” squeaked Dobby.“‘ But past an hour—’”“—‘ the prospect’s black,’” Harry recited, staring, horror- struck, at the elf.“‘ Too late, it’s gone, it won’t come back.’ Dobby— what’ve I got to do?”“You has to eat this, sir!” squeaked the elf, and he put his hand in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy, grayish- green rat tails.“Right",the elf

Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn’t.“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George’s room,” said Ron quietly.“Great long price lists for stuff they’ve invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they’d been inventing all that…”“We’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually making things,” said Ginny.“We thought they just liked the noise.”“Only, most of the stuff— well, all of it, really— was a bit dangerous,” said Ron,“and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money, and Mum went mad at them. Told them they weren’t allowed to make any more of it, and burned all the order forms.… She’s furious at them anyway. They didn’t get as many O.W.L.s as she expected.” O.W.L.s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the examinations Hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen.“And then there was this big row,” Ginny said,“because Mum wants them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad, and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop",Ginny

Silence!” Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling. Then the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.“I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you, and I will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few more months will make no difference. As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will be effective.

If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died. You will do it quietly and without fuss; I only wish that I could do it myself, but in my present condition… Come, Wormtail, one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear.

From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people— Slytherins, mainly— quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering comments.“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?”“Since when have you been one of the top students in the school, Potter?

Dobby now handed Harry a small package, which turned out to be— socks.“Dobby is making them himself, sir!” the elf said happily.“He is buying the wool out of his wages, sir!” The left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the right sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.“They’re… they’re really… well, thanks, Dobby,” said Harry, and he pulled them on, causing Dobby’s eyes to leak with happiness again.“Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas dinner in the kitchens!” said Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving good- bye to Ron and the others as he passed.

"“but she’d be well up to making a Love Potion,",170407,170435,True,453:Pansy Parkinson.F,"another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss. Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone can not satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with both boys’ affections. Krum, who is openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has“never felt this way about any other girl.” However, it might not be Miss Granger’s doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys’ interest.“She’s really ugly,” says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourth- year student,“but she’d be well up to making a Love Potion, she’s quite brainy. I think that’s how she’s doing it.” Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims. In the meantime, Harry Potter’s well- wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate.“I told you!” Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article.“I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter! She’s made you out to be some sort of— of scarlet woman!” Hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter.“Scarlet woman?” she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at Ron.“It’s what my mum calls them,” Ron muttered, his ears going red.“If that’s the best Rita can do, she",Pansy Parkinson

He was flying in ascending circles, effortlessly. He was not singed. He was not burning, and there was this wonderful glowing thing in his beak that, indeed, seemed to flood his entire being with an extraordinary feeling. It was as if every single one of his hollow bones, every feather shaft brimmed with this feeling of transcendent power. Joy filled him, a joy such as he had never felt since perhaps the first time he had ever flown. But how he got this coal was still a mystery to him. He flew back to the ridge where the buckets were. Martin was beside him.“You were spectacular, Soren. I was so nervous when I saw that crown fire break and then when we saw you getting sucked up, I nearly went yeep.”“But what happened?” Soren asked. They were to stay on the ridge until the rest of the chaw returned.“You mean to tell me you don’t know?”“Not exactly.”“You did a reverse loop to escape the pull and as you were coming out of it this coal flew by. Bubo said he never saw a coal of that size go up so high, but you caught it! Caught it on the loop, Soren. I mean it was better flying than anything Ruby has ever done. It was absolutely spectacular.”“Great Glaux, I wish I’d seen it,” Soren said. Martin hooted loudly.“You did it, Soren! You did it!” Otulissa flew in next with Ruby and Poot",Martin

Ezylryb began a steeply banking turn. The others followed. Bubo and Poot arrived shortly with fresh voles and mice in their talons, some still squirming.“Eat light, eat all the hair!” Ezylryb barked.“I wonder why he always calls it hair?” Martin said quietly.“They say he comes from a distant place called the land of the Great North Waters and they have odd ways of speaking,” Ruby said.“But hair? What’s hair?” Martin persisted.“Well, there’s fur and there’s feathers— I think it’s something in between,” Ruby said.“Do you want me to ask Otulissa?”“No!” Soren and Martin both groaned. Less than an hour had passed when Bubo flew down from his higher perch.“Prepare to fly.” The owls stood on the thin granite lip of the ridge, their talons hooked over the edge. They spread their wings, and Bubo gave the command.“FIRE!” They lifted off— first Bubo and Elvan, then Ruby and Poot, next Otulissa, Soren, and Martin, and last, as a rear guard, Ezyl- ryb.

But he heard Mrs. P. muttering after the other snake was out of earshot.“To presume to have a gizzard and then go slithering off to Octavia, humming tunes and besieging her with milkberries. Well, I never!” Soren decided to skip visiting Mrs. P. He knew what he must do. He must“drop by” Madame Plonk’s, and he must tell her that here was a very special snake, a snake that had something even finer than a gizzard, a snake of the highest— what was that word Mrs. P. was always using?—“Sensibilities, artistic sensibilities.” CHAPTER NINETEEN A Visit to Madame Plonk You see, Madame Plonk, I know that perhaps this is not proper— me coming to you this way.” Soren could hardly keep his mind on what he was saying, as he had never in his life seen a hollow like this one. The air spun with colored light from the whirlyglasses that hung from the ceiling and sometimes jutted out from the walls, suspended on twigs jammed into cracks. There were several openings through which light poured. There were pieces of cloth embroidered with beautiful designs and one little niche spilled over with strands of luminous beads. Indeed, the hollow seemed to swirl with color. And in the middle of all this color there was a dazzling whiteness— Madame Plonk. Soren gulped and tried to keep his eyes from straying from that whiteness.“But I just know that Mrs. P. is rather shy and would never dare.”“Mrs. P.?” Madame Plonk broke in.“I don’t believe I know this snake.”“She came with me, ma’am. She’s my family’s old nest- maid snake.”“Oh, and you were saying that she wants to be in the harp guild?”“Yes, ma’am.” Soren thought he sounded so stupid. Who cares? he thought. He was here for Mrs. P. She wanted this so much. Then it was as if Madame Plonk nearly took his next thought directly out of his head.“But wanting is one thing. One can not merely",ME

They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait.” Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words“Ministry of Magic,”“wizards,” and“Muggles.” Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of menace in the cold voice now. A slight pause followed— and then Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.“It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord.” Another pause, more protracted, and then—“Without Harry",Frank

After half an hour or so, Hermione, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried herself once more in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a Summoning Charm. Neville listened jealously to the others’ conversation as they relived the Cup match.“Gran didn’t want to go,” he said miserably.“Wouldn’t buy tickets. It sounded amazing though.”“It was,” said Ron.“Look at this, Neville.…” He rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature figure of Viktor Krum.“Oh wow,” said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum onto his pudgy hand.“We saw him right up close, as well,” said Ron.“We were in the Top Box—”“For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.” Draco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway.

As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while.

He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next— for neither family stayed long. Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair.

I have been here much longer than you and still have not yet become a member of a chaw.”“What’s a chaw?” Soren said.“You are selected to join a chaw— a small team of owls— and you will learn a skill that is helpful.”“In battle?” Twilight asked.“Not just battle— in life. There is more to life than just battles. Each chaw has its own, oh, how should I put it? Personality.

Weather interpretation and colliering are decidely rough and uncouth.

Would he be up to it? He had to be. With his friends, he could. Look what they had accomplished so far!“Do we all get to be in the same chaw?” Soren asked.“Probably not.”“But we’re a band.” Soren hoped that he did not sound as if he were pleading.“That doesn’t matter now.

Just then, like a shooting star, something red whizzed by.“Beautiful catch, Ruby,” shouted Poot.“What a natural that Short- eared Owl is!” Elvan gasped in amazement. Ruby began to wing off toward the coal buckets that Bubo had set up on the ridge. The small buckets made in his forge, with bits of kindling in the bottom already lit, would keep the coals hot.“All right, Martin going in!” Elvan called out the command. The little owl began a tight spiraling plunge to earth.“Cover him, Soren.” Soren would fly cover until Martin returned with a beakful of cinders. Elvan actually carried the very small cinder pot in his talons. Martin was supposed to not only collect cinders but report back on the larger coals that Soren and Otulissa were to retrieve. Soren hovered above with a careful eye on the little owl. He was getting used to the noise. Indeed, not only was he getting used to it but within the thunderous roar he could seek out smaller sounds, like the sound of Martin’s beating heart, which grew more rapid as he plunged. As Martin’s heartbeat quickened, Soren hoped with all his heart, gizzard, and soul that the little Saw- whet Owl would be all right.

If Cedric had been outside the time limit, he most certainly had been.“Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration, which was nevertheless effective, and was second to return with his hostage.

Easy flying.” The other owls were already up and standing at the rim of the hollow. The wall certainly was weeping. Glistening with wetness, it appeared shimmering, almost fiery as the setting sun turned its ice into liquid flames of pink, then orange and red.“Dumpy,” his father called.“Come over here, son. I want you to step up here and watch the young’uns fly. They are the masters of silent flight.

Neville looked around.“Oh hello,” he said, his voice much higher than usual.“Interesting lesson, wasn’t it? I wonder what’s for dinner, I’m— I’m starving, aren’t you?”“Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.“Oh yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice.“Very interesting dinner— I mean lesson— what’s for eating?” Ron gave Harry a startled look.“Neville, what—?” But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard.“It’s all right, sonny,” he said to Neville.“Why don’t you come up to my office?

These shall be your rybs.” With those words, Boron swept his wings toward the walls of the hollow. There were ledges that hung like galleries above. Soren, Twilight, Gylfie, and Digger gasped as they saw a great gathering of owls— all kinds of owls from Burrowing ones to Barn Owls, from Pygmy Owls to Elf Owls, from Screech Owls to Sooty Owls, from Great Horned Owls to Snowy Owls. Every kind of owl imaginable was here within the hollow of the great tree, their yellow, black, and amber eyes blinking and winking in the most friendly and inquisitive manner at the five new arrivals. Barran continued,“Welcome, young ones. Welcome to the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. One journey has ended…” Just one? thought Soren. But just then a series of deep, rolling gongs began to shake the entire tree. Barran stopped mid- speech.“Chaws— back up to your positions!” This hoot came from a Great Gray Owl in the gallery. Then, it seemed as if the entire hollow suddenly brightened as owls began donning battle claws and helmets, and the flames of the candles flickered off the bright polished surfaces of the armored owls.“Great Glaux— a battle! Quick, let’s get our claws!” Twilight began to hop up and down, pumping his wings.“Not so fast, young’un.” A plump, Short- eared Owl waddled up to them.“But where’s the battle?” Twilight said.“Beyond the",Barran

She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and Harry’s names. Harry had never been through here before.

It was all hushed up, though. But he’s made friends with werewolves and giants too. We think he’d do anything for a bit of power.” Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a Dark Art. Indeed, the most famous Parselmouth of our times is none other than You- Know- Who himself. A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue“as worthy of investigation. Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with evildoers.” Similarly,“anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence.” Albus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Some fear that Potter might resort to the Dark Arts in his desperation to win the tournament, the third task of which takes place this evening.“Gone off me a bit, hasn’t she?” said Harry lightly, folding up the paper. Over at the Slytherin table, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were laughing at him, tapping their heads with their fingers, pulling grotesquely mad faces, and waggling their tongues like snakes.“How did she know your scar hurt in Divination?” Ron said.“There",A member of the Dark Force Defense League

And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!”“Cool!” said Colin, just as excitedly.“It was probably the giant squid, Dennis!”“Wow!” said Dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a storm- tossed, fathoms- deep lake, and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster.“Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one with the black hair and glasses? See him? Know who he is, Dennis?” Harry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now Sorting Emma Dobbs.

I think they are only necessary when we are in areas near battle zones. So often the parents are off fighting. In normal circumstances, the parents are there if a fire breaks out, but tonight, for instance, we had to pick up that little Pygmy and a Northern Saw- whet. We got them back, but it taxed our chaw, believe me— carrying coals and injured owlets. Can’t exactly drop them in the coal bucket. And I don’t even like to think of the ones we might have missed and left behind.” The old Whiskered Screech raised his deformed foot.“Yes, Ezylryb?” Boron nodded to the owl.“Question for Bubo.” the Whiskered Screech’s voice was a low growl.“You think this fire was natural or more trouble with the rogue raids?”“No telling, sir.

When they first had met Hortense at St. Aggie’s, they thought she was the most perfectly moon- blinked creature ever. Moon blinking was perhaps the cruelest thing that St. Aggie’s did to young owls.

He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high- ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing,“Harry Potter, sir! Harry Potter!” Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.“D- Dobby?” Harry gasped.“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel.“Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!” Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis- ball- shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil- shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and feet— all except the clothes, which were very different. When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on which he had pinned a number of bright badges; a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest",the squealing elf
"You see,",5362,5434,True,142:Swatums.?,"“there is nothing simple. It’s just that it has been said that the Great Ga’Hoole Tree is invisible. That it grows on the island in the middle of a vast sea, a sea called Hoolemere that is nearly as wide as an ocean. A sea that is always wrapped in fog, an island feathered in blizzards, and a tree veiled in mist.”“So,” said Twilight,“it’s not really invisible, it’s just bad weather.”“Not exactly,” replied Swatums. Twilight cocked his head.“It seems that for some the fog lifts, the blizzards stop, and the mist blows away.”“For some?” asked Gylfie.“For those who believe.” Swatums paused and then sniffed in disdain.“But do they say what? Believe in what? No. You see, that is the problem. Owls with fancy ideas— ridiculous! That’s how you get into trouble. Sweetums and I don’t believe in fancy ideas. Fancy ideas don’t keep the belly full and the gizzard grinding. Sugar gliders, plump rats, voles— that’s what counts.” Sweetums nodded and Swatums went over and began preening her for the millionth time that day. Soren knew in that moment that even if he were starving to death, he would still find Sweetums and Swatums the most boring owls on Earth. That late afternoon as they nestled in the hollow, waiting for First Black, Gylfie stirred sleepily.“You awake, Soren?”“Yeah. I can’t wait to get to Hoolemere.”“Me, neither. But I was wondering,” Gylfie said.“Wondering what?”“Do you think that Streak and Zan love each other as much as Sweetums and Swatums?” Streak and Zan were two Bald Eagles who had helped them in the desert when Digger had been attacked by the lieutenants from St. Aggie’s— the very",Swatums

Can’t we go?”“Nonsense. You know how we feel about make- believe.” The little owlet dipped his head in embarrassment.“It’s not make- believe,” said Gylfie.“Oh, you can’t be serious, young’un,” said the male.“It’s just a story, an old legend.”“Let me tell you something,” said the female, who Soren disliked more and more by the second.“It does not do any good to believe in things you can not see, touch, or feel. It is a waste of time. From the look of your flight feathers’ development, not to mention your talons, it is apparent that you are either fly- aways or orphans. Why else would you be out cavorting about the skies at such dangerous hours of the morning? I think your parents would be ashamed of you. I can tell you have good breeding.” She looked directly at Soren and blinked. Soren thought he might explode with anger. How did this owl know what his parents might think? How dare she suggest that she knew them so well that she knew they would be ashamed of him? And then there was a small soft, hissing voice.“I am ashamed of anyone who has eyes and still can not see.” It was Mrs. Plithiver. She slithered from the corner in the hollow.“But, of course, to see with two eyes is a very common thing.”“What is she talking about?” said the male.“What happened to the old days when servants served and were quiet?

She led them past the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses were standing, huddled against the cold, and toward a tree on the edge of the forest, where a large and beautiful unicorn was tethered. Many of the girls“ooooohed!” at the sight of the unicorn.“Oh it’s so beautiful!” whispered Lavender Brown.“How did she get it? They’re supposed to be really hard to catch!” The unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look gray.

Gylfie suddenly turned to him.“I think they’re worried about Ezylryb.” Soren blinked.“Maybe tomorrow we should go out and take a look.” Twilight and Digger alighted at that moment next to them on the branch.“Take a look?” Digger asked.“A look for what?”“Ezylryb,” Twilight said.“I heard them talking, too.” There was a sudden pulsing of light in the sky and then a gasp from all the owls as a radiance swept the black night.“What is it? What is it?”“Oh, great Glaux, we are blessed!” hooted Barran.“It is the Aurora Glaucora,” Boron sang out. Soren, Gylfie, Digger, Twilight, and Eglantine all looked at one another. They had no idea what Barran and Boron were talking about. But the sky seemed rinsed with colors, colors that streamed like banners through the night. Suddenly, Madame Plonk abandoned her perch by the harp and flew out into the brilliance of the night. Still singing, she swept through the long lances of light, her white body reflecting the colors. It was irresistible. Soren remembered that morning months ago when he and Madame Plonk had flown through the rainbow. But the rainbow was pale next to these pulsing banners of light that draped the sky. His worries about Ezylryb grew dimmer as the colors grew brighter. The",Barran

Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail’s right.“Lucius, my slippery friend,” he whispered, halting before him.“I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle- torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius.… Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay… but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?”“My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,” came Lucius Malfoy’s voice swiftly from beneath the hood.“Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me—”“And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?” said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly.“Yes, I know all about that, Lucius.… You have disappointed me.… I expect more faithful service in the future.”“Of course, my Lord, of course.… You are merciful, thank you.…” Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space— large enough for two people— that separated Malfoy and the next man.“The Lestranges should stand here,” said Voldemort quietly.“But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me.… When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges",Lucius Malfoy

It had the body of an over- large lion: great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman. She turned her long, almond- shaped eyes upon Harry as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress. Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.“You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.”“So… so will you move, please?” said Harry, knowing what the answer was going to be.“No,” she said, continuing to pace.“Not unless you can answer my riddle. Answer on your first guess— I let you pass. Answer wrongly— I attack. Remain silent— I will let you walk away from me unscathed.” Harry’s stomach slipped several notches. It was Hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he could keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative route to the center.“Okay,” he said.“Can I hear the riddle?” The sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of the path, and recited:“First think of the person who lives in disguise,",a woman

Highly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different- colored steam wafting all around him, no stroke of brilliance came to him, no sudden burst of understanding. Harry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and opened it. The wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating off the marble walls, but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever, if not more so with all the echoes. He snapped it shut again, worried that the sound would attract Filch, wondering whether that hadn’t been Cedric’s plan— and then, making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered away across the bathroom floor, someone spoke.“I’d try putting it in the water, if I were you.” Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He stood up, sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glum- looking girl sitting cross- legged on top of one of the taps. It was Moaning Myrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the S- bend of a toilet three floors below.“Myrtle!” Harry said in outrage,“I’m— I’m not wearing anything!” The foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had arrived.“I closed my eyes when you got in,” she said, blinking at him through her thick spectacles.“You haven’t been to see me",someone

I now ask the jury—”“Mother!” screamed the boy below, and the wispy little witch beside Crouch began to sob, rocking backward and forward.“Mother, stop him, Mother, I didn’t do it, it wasn’t me!”“I now ask the jury,” shouted Mr. Crouch,“to raise their hands if they believe, as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban!” In unison, the witches and wizards along the right- hand side of the dungeon raised their hands. The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for Bagman, their faces full of savage triumph. The boy began to scream.“No! Mother, no! I didn’t do it, I didn’t do it, I didn’t know! Don’t send me there, don’t let him!” The dementors were gliding back into the room. The boys’ three companions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy- lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called,“The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban; we will wait! He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!” But the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though Harry could see their cold, draining power starting to affect him. The crowd was jeering, some of them on their feet, as the woman swept out of the dungeon, and the boy continued to struggle.“I’m your son!” he",the boy

He turned his head and called across the common room,“Oi! Angelina!” Angelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over at him.“What?” she called back.“Want to come to the ball with me?” Angelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look.“All right, then,” she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face.“There you go,” said Fred to Harry and Ron,“piece of cake.” He got to his feet, yawning, and said,“We’d better use a school owl then, George, come on.…” They left. Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at Harry.“We should get a move on, you know… ask someone. He’s right. We don’t want to end up with a pair of trolls.” Hermione let out a sputter of indignation.“A pair",Angelina
"Guess what,",57623,57643,True,361:Colin.M,"that his head didn’t wobble too much on his partially severed neck.“Good evening,” he said, beaming at them.“Says who?” said Harry, taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water.“Hope they hurry up with the Sorting. I’m starving.” The Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn’t been present at one since his own. He was quite looking forward to it. Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.“Hiya, Harry!” It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s starting! My brother Dennis!”“Er— good,” said Harry.“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat.“I just hope he’s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?”“Er— yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick.“Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor.“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione.“Parvati Patil’s twin’s in Ravenclaw, and they’re identical.

"We got them back,",22988,23101,True,188:the Whiskered Screech.M,"a perpetual squint, and his beak had a notch in it.“I’ve never seen a more disreputable- looking owl,” Gyl- fie whispered.“Great Glaux, look at his foot! His talons!” She paused.“Or lack of!” The Whiskered Screech, indeed, had only three talons on one foot. And just as Soren was blinking in a mixture of astonishment and horror, the old owl swung his head about and fixed Soren in his squinted gaze. Soren thought his gizzard was going to drop right out of him.“So, Elvanryb,” Boron turned and addressed another owl, a Great Gray.“It is your notion that we need to have a search- and- rescue attachment chaw on the colliering missions?”“Not all, Boron. I think they are only necessary when we are in areas near battle zones. So often the parents are off fighting. In normal circumstances, the parents are there if a fire breaks out, but tonight, for instance, we had to pick up that little Pygmy and a Northern Saw- whet. We got them back, but it taxed our chaw, believe me— carrying coals and injured owlets. Can’t exactly drop them in the coal bucket. And I don’t even like to think of the ones we might have missed and left behind.” The old Whiskered Screech raised his deformed foot.“Yes, Ezylryb?” Boron nodded to the owl.“Question for Bubo.” the Whiskered Screech’s voice was a low growl.“You think this fire was natural or more trouble with the rogue raids?”“No telling, sir. The rogues make good targets, and it wouldn’t be the first time raiding one caused a fire.”“Hmmm,” the Whiskered Screech replied, and then scratched his head with the second of the three remaining talons of one foot.“Next order of business,” Boron said.“Something about starvation in Ambala?” Ambala!

Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered.“I told you… it was an accident.…”“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back.“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman… but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays on, you don’t need to be a genius to tell which one’s the better flier!”“Must be nearly time,” said Mr. Weasley quickly, pulling out his watch again.“Do you know whether we’re waiting for any more, Amos?”“No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts couldn’t get tickets,” said Mr. Diggory.“There aren’t any more of us in this area, are there?”“Not that I know of,” said Mr. Weasley.“Yes, it’s a minute off.… We’d better get ready.…” He looked around at Harry and Hermione.“You just need to touch the Portkey, that’s all, a finger will do—” With difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the nine of them crowded around the old boot held",Amos Diggory
"“Well,",93373,93380,True,2112:the Fat Lady.F,"some distant country, in hiding, alone… feeble and powerless.… Yet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar hurting, Voldemort had not been alone… he had been talking to Wormtail… plotting Harry’s murder.… Harry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady already. He had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady,“Violet’s just told me everything. Who’s just been chosen as school champion, then?”“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly.“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room. The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.“You should’ve told us you’d entered!",the Fat Lady

He was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water; clearly, Dumbledore could speak Mermish. Finally he straightened up, turned to his fellow judges, and said,“A conference before we give the marks, I think.” The judges went into a huddle. Madam Pomfrey had gone to rescue Ron from Percy’s clutches; she led him over to Harry and the others, gave him a blanket and some Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and her sister. Fleur had many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn, but she didn’t seem to care, nor would she allow Madam Pomfrey to clean them.“Look after Gabrielle,” she told her, and then she turned to Harry.“You saved’ er,” she said breathlessly.“Even though she was not your’ ostage.”“Yeah,” said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he’d left all three girls tied to the statue. Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek(he felt his face burn and wouldn’t have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again), then said to Ron,“And you too— you’ elped—”“Yeah,” said Ron, looking extremely hopeful,“yeah, a bit—” Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him.

He slipped his wand back into his robes, waited until Cedric’s friends had disappeared into their classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of everyone but himself and Cedric.“Hi,” said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration that was now splattered with ink.“My bag just split… brand- new and all…”“Cedric,” said Harry,“the first task is dragons.”“What?” said Cedric, looking up.“Dragons,” said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had got to.“They’ve got four, one for each of us, and we’ve got to get past them.” Cedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic he’d been feeling since Saturday night flickering in Cedric’s gray eyes.“Are you sure?” Cedric said in a hushed voice.“Dead sure,” said Harry.“I’ve seen them.”“But how did you find out? We’re not supposed to know.…”“Never mind,” said Harry quickly— he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth.“But I’m not the only one who knows.

"“Potter,",180782,180801,True,453:Pansy Parkinson.F,"cradling her hands.“I warned her not to annoy Rita Skeeter! Look at this one…” He read out one of the letters Hermione had left behind:“‘ I read in Witch Weekly about how you are playing Harry Potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and I will be sending you a curse by next post as soon as I can find a big enough envelope.’ Blimey, she’d better watch out for herself.” Hermione didn’t turn up for Herbology. As Harry and Ron left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle. Pansy Parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of Slytherin girls. Catching sight of Harry, Pansy called,“Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend? Why was she so upset at breakfast?” Harry ignored her; he didn’t want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused. Hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns, was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet. Harry’s heart sank at the sight of the crates— surely not another skrewt hatching?— but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number of fluffy black creatures with long snouts. Their front paws were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention.“These’re nifflers,” said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around.“Yeh find’em down mines",Pansy Parkinson

Like most, this hollow had both an inside and an outside entrance so that one could either fly in or walk in from one of the many inner pathways through the trunk of the tree. He peeked in. He saw the Short- eared Owl called Matron who had led them to their own hollow. She was bustling about, plucking down from her own breast and tucking it in around an owl.“Now, now, dear, we know you did your best.”“But what will Mum and Da think?” For a moment Soren’s gizzard gave a lurch. Could this little owl be Eglantine?“They will think that you were a brave little Pygmy Owl,” Matron replied. Soren sighed.“What are you doing out there? Just don’t stand around, come in and make yourself useful,” Matron called. Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren",Matron

Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories.“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked as they climbed. Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn’t.“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George’s room,” said Ron quietly.“Great long price lists for stuff they’ve invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they’d been inventing all that…”“We’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually making things,” said Ginny.“We thought they just liked the noise.”“Only, most of the stuff— well, all of it, really— was a bit dangerous,” said Ron,“and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money, and Mum went mad at them.

Chapter 3 The Invitation By the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys were already seated around the table. None of them looked up as he entered or sat down. Uncle Vernon’s large red face was hidden behind the morning’s Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike teeth. Dudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual. This was saying something, as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself. When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto Dudley’s plate with a tremulous“There you are, Diddy darling,” Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end- of- year report. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn’t understand him, while Uncle Vernon maintained that“he didn’t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway.” They also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report—“He’s a boisterous little boy, but he wouldn’t hurt a fly!” Aunt Petunia had said tearfully. However, at the bottom of the report there were a few well- chosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could",Aunt Petunia

As Madam Pomfrey led Harry to a nearby bed, he caught sight of the real Moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room. His wooden leg and magical eye were lying on the bedside table.“Is he okay?” Harry asked.“He’ll be fine,” said Madam Pomfrey, giving Harry some pajamas and pulling screens around him. He took off his robes, pulled on the pajamas, and got into bed. Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs. Weasley, and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him. Ron and Hermione were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.“I’m all right,” he told them.“Just tired.” Mrs. Weasley’s eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bedcovers unnecessarily. Madam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office, returned holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a goblet.“You’ll need to drink all of this, Harry,” she said.“It’s a potion for",Madam Pomfrey

I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably. A bunchy Barred Owl poked her head in.“Any tea here?”“Oh, yes, I think a cup of milkberry tea would be lovely.”“I dropped the egg. I don’t deserve to live.” Primrose emitted a long sound halfway between a whistle and a wail.“Don’t say that!” Soren exclaimed.“Of course you deserve to live. Every owl deserves to live. That’s why we came here.” Matron stopped what she was doing and cocked her head and regarded the young Barn Owl. Perhaps he was learning; just perhaps he was beginning to catch a glimmer of the true meaning of a noble deed. She would leave him to comfort this little Pygmy Owl and send in an extra cup of tea and some milkberry tart. Soren stayed with Primrose for the rest of the evening. She was sometimes a bit feverish and would begin to mumble about the little brother she was sure she had killed. She had wanted to call him Osgood. Other",the little owl

They waited and waited, then looked at one another.“Sir,” Gylfie began,“I think something might have happened to your mate… uh… er… She dove into the sea and no sign of her yet.”“Oh, she’ll be a while.

There she is!” Gylfie said.“Good old Ma,” Dumpy sighed.“Hope she brought some capelin. I just love capelin. If you don’t like it, will you give me yours? Please, please, please?”“Sure,” Soren said. Every minute that he stayed in this smelly hollow he was getting less hungry.“Look at that,” Twilight said.“How’s she going to get off?” The others now crowded to the edge of the ice hollow. Down below, it appeared that the female was trying to run across the surface of the water while madly flapping her wings.“Water takeoff— not easy for any of us. We’re not the best fliers, but, as you can see, we can dive. Got these little air pockets so we can go really deep for a long, long time.

As they passed Amos Diggory, he looked around.“There you are, are you?” he said, looking Harry up and down.“Bet you’re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric’s caught you up on points, are you?”“What?” said Harry.“Ignore him,” said Cedric in a low voice to Harry, frowning after his father.“He’s been angry ever since Rita Skeeter’s article about the Triwizard Tournament— you know, when she made out you were the only Hogwarts champion.”“Didn’t bother to correct her, though, did he?” said Amos Diggory, loudly enough for Harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with Mrs. Weasley and Bill.“Still… you’ll show him, Ced.

Glistening with wetness, it appeared shimmering, almost fiery as the setting sun turned its ice into liquid flames of pink, then orange and red.“Dumpy,” his father called.“Come over here, son. I want you to step up here and watch the young’uns fly. They are the masters of silent flight. Never going to hear a wing flap with these owls!” Just before they took off, Soren looked at each of the owls. He wasn’t the only one who had dreamed of the Mirror Lakes. They all wanted to go back. Could it be that wrong if they all wanted to do it? Twilight slid in close to him.“Soren, the three of us have been thinking.”“Yes?”“Thinking about The Beaks and the Mirror Lakes. We’ve been thinking, why not go back there for just a little while? You know, just to kind of rest up",his father
"“And please,",43356,43387,True,218:Octavia.F,"before I had acquired the taste for hair and thought I could go through that hurricane. Last time I ever tried that. Nearly got caught in the rim of the eye, I did. Now, you don’t want to do that, young’uns.” Poot was a Boreal Owl like Soren and Gylfie’s old friend Grimble.“What happens if you get caught in the rim of the eye of a hurricane?” asked Rudy.“Oh, you spin around till you’re dead. Just around and around and around. Awful nasty way to go. Usually get your wings torn off in the process,” said Poot.“Now, don’t go scaring them, Poot,” Octavia said and gave a ripple so that all their plates clattered a bit.“And please, young’uns, don’t try that trick of slipping the fur under the table. Remember, I am the table and it itches something fierce.” It was not even dark yet, but the weather chaw owls were already on the takeoff limb. It was all they could do to hang on as the gale lashed about them and the limb bucked in the turbulent wind. Shards of ice flew through the air.“We take off upwind, naturally.” Although Soren was not sure in this gale which way upwind even was.“We’re going to fly straight out over the Sea of Hoolemere. Try to find the main part of the gale.” Ezylryb spoke in short snappish sentences.“Now listen up. Here’s what you need to know about a gale, or any storm, really— except for hurricanes— they be a little different with their eyes and all. But what you got in a gale",Octavia

Dobby heard Professor McGonagall and Professor Moody in the staffroom, talking about the next task.… Dobby can not let Harry Potter lose his Wheezy!” Harry’s doubts vanished. Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels.“Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!” Dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor.“Dobby will be missed— good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!”“",the elf

Could this little owl be Eglantine?“They will think that you were a brave little Pygmy Owl,” Matron replied. Soren sighed.“What are you doing out there? Just don’t stand around, come in and make yourself useful,” Matron called. Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably. A bunchy Barred Owl poked her head in.“Any tea here?”“Oh, yes, I think a cup of milkberry tea would be lovely.”“I dropped the egg.

What are your plans?”“We’re going to Hoolemere and the Great Ga’Hoole Tree,” Soren said.“Oh, how interesting,” the female replied in a voice that had a sneer embedded in it.“Oh, Mummy,” said the young owlet.“That’s the place I was telling you about. Can’t we go?”“Nonsense. You know how we feel about make- believe.” The little owlet dipped his head in embarrassment.“It’s not make- believe,” said Gylfie.“Oh, you can’t be serious, young’un,” said the male.“It’s just a story, an old legend.”“Let me tell you something,” said the female, who Soren disliked more and more by the second.“It does not do any good to believe in things you can not see, touch, or feel.

"“Welcome,",19211,19229,True,172:Barran.F,"there are many skills you shall be able to learn here in the Great Ga’Hoole Tree, and we are all here to teach you. These shall be your rybs.” With those words, Boron swept his wings toward the walls of the hollow. There were ledges that hung like galleries above. Soren, Twilight, Gylfie, and Digger gasped as they saw a great gathering of owls— all kinds of owls from Burrowing ones to Barn Owls, from Pygmy Owls to Elf Owls, from Screech Owls to Sooty Owls, from Great Horned Owls to Snowy Owls. Every kind of owl imaginable was here within the hollow of the great tree, their yellow, black, and amber eyes blinking and winking in the most friendly and inquisitive manner at the five new arrivals. Barran continued,“Welcome, young ones. Welcome to the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. One journey has ended…” Just one? thought Soren. But just then a series of deep, rolling gongs began to shake the entire tree. Barran stopped mid- speech.“Chaws— back up to your positions!” This hoot came from a Great Gray Owl in the gallery. Then, it seemed as if the entire hollow suddenly brightened as owls began donning battle claws and helmets, and the flames of the candles flickered off the bright polished surfaces of the armored owls.“Great Glaux— a battle! Quick, let’s get our claws!” Twilight began to hop up and down, pumping his wings.“Not so fast, young’un.” A plump, Short- eared Owl waddled up to them.“But where’s the battle?” Twilight said.“Beyond the",Barran

Dobby was right. It was twenty past nine. A large, dead weight seemed to fall through Harry’s chest into his stomach.“Hurry, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, plucking at Harry’s sleeve.“You is supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions, sir!”“It’s too late, Dobby,” Harry said hopelessly.“I’m not doing the task, I don’t know how—”“Harry Potter will do the task!” squeaked the elf.“Dobby knew Harry had not found the right book, so Dobby did it for him!”“What?” said Harry.“But you don’t know what the second task is—”“Dobby knows, sir!

Soren had been joined by Twilight, Digger, and Gylfie at the edge of the nest. They waited and waited, then looked at one another.“Sir,” Gylfie began,“I think something might have happened to your mate… uh… er… She dove into the sea and no sign of her yet.”“Oh, she’ll be a while. Lot of mouths to feed.” It seemed like forever, but then they saw her break through the surface. Several small fish hung neatly from her beak.“There she is! There she is!” Gylfie said.“Good old Ma,” Dumpy sighed.“Hope she brought some capelin. I just love capelin. If you don’t like it, will you give me yours? Please, please, please?”“Sure,” Soren said. Every minute that he stayed in this smelly hollow he was getting less hungry.“Look at that,” Twilight said.“How’s she going to get off?” The others now crowded to the edge of the ice hollow. Down below, it appeared that the female was trying to run across the surface of the water while madly flapping her wings.“Water takeoff— not easy for any of us. We’re not the best fliers, but, as you can see, we can dive. Got these little air pockets so we can go really deep for a long, long time.

There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.“Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn’t.”“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar,“he had a hard war, Frank. He likes the quiet life.

She’s a nest- maid,” his mate said in a haughty voice. Mrs. Plithiver seemed to fade a bit. She nudged one of the worms that had begun to crawl off Digger’s wing.“She had everything to do with it!” Soren bristled up and suddenly seemed almost as big as the Masked Owls.“If it hadn’t been for Mrs. P., I would have been dive- bombed from the rear and poor Digger would have never made it back.” The Masked Owls blinked.“Well, well.” The large female chuffed and stepped nervously from one talon to another.“We just aren’t used to such aggressive behavior from our nest- maids.

"“Because,",2737,2804,True,175:Frank.M,"My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?”“A week,” said the cold voice.“Perhaps longer. The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan can not proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.” Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word“Quidditch,” which was not a word at all.“The— the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said Wormtail.(Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.)“Forgive me, but— I do not understand— why should we wait until the World Cup is over?”“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, checking and double- checking identities. They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait.” Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words“Ministry of Magic,”“wizards,” and“Muggles.” Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of menace in the cold voice now. A slight pause followed— and then Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.“It could be",Frank
"“Cover him,",51758,51764,True,685:the little owl.F,"now circled back. He had been flying far out in front.“Good ember beds ahead. Perfect for all of you.” So this was it, Soren thought. This was when they became true colliers. Just then, like a shooting star, something red whizzed by.“Beautiful catch, Ruby,” shouted Poot.“What a natural that Short- eared Owl is!” Elvan gasped in amazement. Ruby began to wing off toward the coal buckets that Bubo had set up on the ridge. The small buckets made in his forge, with bits of kindling in the bottom already lit, would keep the coals hot.“All right, Martin going in!” Elvan called out the command. The little owl began a tight spiraling plunge to earth.“Cover him, Soren.” Soren would fly cover until Martin returned with a beakful of cinders. Elvan actually carried the very small cinder pot in his talons. Martin was supposed to not only collect cinders but report back on the larger coals that Soren and Otulissa were to retrieve. Soren hovered above with a careful eye on the little owl. He was getting used to the noise. Indeed, not only was he getting used to it but within the thunderous roar he could seek out smaller sounds, like the sound of Martin’s beating heart, which grew more rapid as he plunged. As Martin’s heartbeat quickened, Soren hoped with all his heart, gizzard, and soul that the little Saw- whet Owl would be all right. He could see now that Martin was on the ground.“Play your",the little owl

Its voice was higher even than Dobby’s had been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected— though it was very hard to tell with a house- elf— that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.“Sorry,” Harry told the elf,“I just thought you were someone I knew.”“But I knows Dobby too, sir!” squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit.“My name is Winky, sir— and you, sir—” Her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon Harry’s scar.“You is surely Harry Potter!”“Yeah, I am,” said Harry.“But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!” she said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck.“How is he?” said Harry.“How’s freedom suiting him?”“Ah, sir,” said Winky, shaking her head,“ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free.”“Why?” said Harry, taken aback.“What’s wrong with him?”“Freedom is going to Dobby’s head,",the elf

Everything around him became hazy; the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed; his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress. Before he could finish the potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep. Harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn’t open his eyes, wanting to drop off again. The room was still dimly lit; he was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he couldn’t have been asleep very long. Then he heard whispering around him.“They’ll wake him if they don’t shut up!”“What are they shouting about? Nothing else can have happened, can it?” Harry opened his eyes blearily Someone had removed his glasses. He could see the fuzzy outlines of Mrs. Weasley and Bill close by. Mrs. Weasley was on her feet.“That’s Fudge’s voice,” she whispered.“And that’s Minerva McGonagall’s, isn’t it? But what are they arguing about?” Now Harry could hear them too: people shouting and running toward the hospital wing.“Regrettable, but all the same, Minerva—” Cornelius Fudge was saying loudly.“You should never have brought it inside the castle!” yelled Professor McGonagall.“When Dumbledore finds out—” Harry heard the hospital doors burst open.

It was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room, beaming at Harry, and walked up to Snape’s desk at the front of the room.“Yes?” said Snape curtly.“Please, sir, I’m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs.” Snape stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded from his eager face.“Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,” said Snape coldly.“He will come upstairs when this class is finished.” Colin went pink.“Sir— sir, Mr. Bagman wants him,” he said nervously.“All the champions have got to go, I think they want to take photographs.…” Harry would have given anything he owned to have stopped Colin saying those last few words. He chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling.“Very well, very well,” Snape snapped.“Potter, leave your things here, I want you back down here later to test your antidote.”“Please, sir— he’s got to take his things with him,” squeaked Colin.“All the champions—”“Very well!” said Snape.“Potter— take your bag and get out of my sight!” Harry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for the door.

Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably. A bunchy Barred Owl poked her head in.“Any tea here?”“Oh, yes, I think a cup of milkberry tea would be lovely.”“I dropped the egg. I don’t deserve to live.” Primrose emitted a long sound halfway between a whistle and a wail.“Don’t say that!” Soren exclaimed.“Of course you deserve to live. Every owl deserves to live. That’s why we came here.” Matron stopped what she was doing and cocked her head and regarded the young Barn Owl. Perhaps he was learning; just perhaps he was beginning to catch a glimmer of the true meaning of a noble deed. She would leave him to comfort this little Pygmy Owl and send in an extra cup of tea and some milkberry tart. Soren stayed with Primrose for the rest of the evening. She was sometimes a bit feverish and would begin to mumble about the little brother she was sure she had killed. She had wanted to call him Osgood. Other",the little owl
"“First pus and now this,”",64917,64924,True,263:Seamus.M,"said a cold voice. The Slytherins had arrived. The speaker was Draco Malfoy. Crabbe and Goyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words. Hagrid looked stumped at the question.“I mean, what do they do?” asked Malfoy.“What is the point of them?” Hagrid opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard; there was a few seconds’ pause, then he said roughly,“Tha’s next lesson, Malfoy. Yer jus’ feedin’’em today.

Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron, and Hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast- Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn’t suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn’t seem to have mouths.“Ouch!” yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes.“It got me! Hagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.“Its end exploded!” said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid a burn on his hand.“Ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off,” said Hagrid, nodding.“Eurgh!” said Lavender Brown again.“Eurgh, Hagrid, what’s that pointy thing on it?”“",Seamus

Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered.“I told you… it was an accident.…”“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back.“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman… but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays on, you don’t need to be a genius to tell which one’s the better flier!”“Must be nearly time,” said Mr. Weasley quickly, pulling out his watch again.“Do you know whether we’re waiting for any more, Amos?”“No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts couldn’t get tickets,” said Mr. Diggory.“There aren’t any more of us in this area, are there?”“Not that I know of",Amos Diggory

She’s a nest- maid,” his mate said in a haughty voice. Mrs. Plithiver seemed to fade a bit. She nudged one of the worms that had begun to crawl off Digger’s wing.“She had everything to do with it!” Soren bristled up and suddenly seemed almost as big as the Masked Owls.“If it hadn’t been for Mrs. P., I would have been dive- bombed from the rear and poor Digger would have never made it back.” The Masked Owls blinked.“Well, well.” The large female chuffed and stepped nervously from one talon to another.“We just aren’t used to such aggressive behavior from our nest- maids.

A sleeve of Ron’s dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious.

I mean— they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety.…”“Eat dung, Malfoy!” said Ron, the same color as the dress robes as he snatched them back out of Malfoy’s grip. Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.“So… going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name? There’s money involved as well, you know… you’d be able to afford some decent robes if you won.…”“What are you talking about?” snapped Ron.“Are you going to enter?” Malfoy repeated.“I suppose you will, Potter? You never miss a chance to show off, do you?”“Either explain what you’re on about or go away, Malfoy,” said Hermione testily, over the top of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4.

All he could remember were the rolls of warm wind to play on, the still, glasslike lake, the everlasting summer. No ice, no blizzard. Why not live there happily ever after? The dream tugged on him. In his sleep, he felt his gizzard turn and something begin to dim, while the longing for The Beaks and the Mirror Lakes grew stronger and stronger.“Time to get up, young’uns.” It was the male puffin, nudging Soren with one of his large, orange, webbed feet.“Wind died down. You can fly out of here now. The wall’s weeping.”“Huh?” Soren asked.“What do you mean the wall’s weeping?”“The ice is melting. Means warm air, the thermals have come.

There were places along the way where small groups of owls gathered to socialize. These seemed to be near the points where some of the larger branches of the tree joined the trunk. There were good- sized openings at these points so that owls could either sit inside on specially constructed perches or outside on the branches themselves.“Now, I want you young’uns to stay out of the way. We’ve got some wounded owls coming in and I have to arrange for their care.” They were flying up through the branches, following the Short- eared Owl to the hollow that would be theirs.“Matron, we’re going to need moss and down. Search- and- rescue’s coming in with two more little ones. Nest decimation.” Another Short- eared Owl flew by with a wad of something fluffy in her talons.“Oh, no!

His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.“They need squeezing. You will collect the pus—”“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout,“and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy",Seamus

It was hollow and completely empty— but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw.“Shut it!” Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again.“Sounded like a banshee.… Maybe you’ve got to get past one of those next, Harry!”“It was someone being tortured!” said Neville, who had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor.“You’re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse!”“Don’t be a prat, Neville, that’s illegal,” said George.“They wouldn’t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions.

Otulissa thought she was too good to have anything to do with Bubo. Neither Bubo nor any of the owls in this chaw had the distinguished background of Otulissa. It was an outrage, as she told Soren forty times a night, that she had not been included in Strix Struma’s navigation chaw.

Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.“Hiya, Harry!” It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s starting! My brother Dennis!”“Er— good,” said Harry.“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat.“I just hope he’s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?”“Er— yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick.“Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom",Colin

A large, dead weight seemed to fall through Harry’s chest into his stomach.“Hurry, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, plucking at Harry’s sleeve.“You is supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions, sir!”“It’s too late, Dobby,” Harry said hopelessly.“I’m not doing the task, I don’t know how—”“Harry Potter will do the task!” squeaked the elf.“Dobby knew Harry had not found the right book, so Dobby did it for him!”“What?” said Harry.“But you don’t know what the second task is—”“Dobby knows, sir! Harry Potter has to go into the lake and find his Wheezy—”“Find my what?”“— and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople!”“What’s a Wheezy?”“Your Wheezy, sir, your Wheezy— Wheezy who is giving Dobby his sweater!” Dobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now wearing over his shorts.“What?” Harry gasped.“They’ve got… they’ve got Ron?”“The thing Harry Potter will miss most, sir!” squeaked Dobby.“‘ But past an hour—’”“—‘ the prospect’s black,’” Harry recited, staring, horror- struck, at the elf.“‘ Too late, it’s gone, it won’t come back.’ Dobby— what’ve I got to do?”“",the elf

The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred; he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed.“How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!” roared George.“I didn’t,” Harry said.“I don’t know how—” But Angelina had now swooped down upon him;“Oh if it couldn’t be me, at least it’s a Gryffindor—”“You’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match, Harry!” shrieked Katie Bell, another of the Gryffindor Chasers.“We’ve got food, Harry, come and have some—”“I’m not hungry, I had enough at the feast—” But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn’t hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn’t put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn’t at all in the mood to celebrate.… Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak.

"Now,",43201,43255,True,219:Poot.?,"the young owls in the weather chaw seemed to have diminished in size. Their feathers were pulled, in tightly indications that the owls were very nervous about their first weather flight. When relaxed, an owl’s plumage is loose and fluffy. When angered, owls can puff up their feathers until they appear much, much larger. But now it was as if they had all become suddenly slim. The tension hovered in the air. Ezylryb fixed the young owls in the amber light of his squinted eye.“Eat up, maties… every single little hair. You’ve forgotten what raw meat tastes like with the fur, as you call it. Poot here is my first mate. He’ll tell you what it’s like to fly with no ballast in your gizzard.”“I remember that time before I had acquired the taste for hair and thought I could go through that hurricane. Last time I ever tried that. Nearly got caught in the rim of the eye, I did. Now, you don’t want to do that, young’uns.” Poot was a Boreal Owl like Soren and Gylfie’s old friend Grimble.“What happens if you get caught in the rim of the eye of a hurricane?” asked Rudy.“Oh, you spin around till you’re dead. Just around and around and around. Awful nasty way to go. Usually get your wings torn off in the process,” said Poot.“Now, don’t go scaring them, Poot,” Octavia said and gave a ripple so that all their plates clattered a bit.“And please, young’uns, don’t try that trick of slipping the fur under the table. Remember, I am the table and it itches something fierce.” It was not even dark yet, but the weather chaw owls were already on the takeoff limb",Poot

That bright orange thing growing from the middle of its, I guess, face?”“What do you mean— you guess, face?” the creature hollered.“I mean, we’re pretty dumb, but you must be dumber if you can’t tell a face from a plant.”“Well, you look a bit like a cactus in bloom— the kind we have in the desert,” Digger said.“That’s my beak, idiot. I can assure you that neither I nor anyone in my family is a cactus in bloom— whatever a cactus is and whatever a desert is.”“Well, what are you?” Mrs. Plithiver finally spoke up.“Well, what in the name of ice are you?” the creature retorted.“I’m a snake… a nest- maid snake.

As they passed Amos Diggory, he looked around.“There you are, are you?” he said, looking Harry up and down.“Bet you’re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric’s caught you up on points, are you?”“What?” said Harry.“Ignore him,” said Cedric in a low voice to Harry, frowning after his father.“He’s been angry ever since Rita Skeeter’s article about the Triwizard Tournament— you know, when she made out you were the only Hogwarts champion.”“Didn’t bother to correct her, though, did he?” said Amos Diggory, loudly enough for Harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with Mrs. Weasley and Bill.“Still… you’ll show him, Ced.

It began to squirm, chuckling, and suddenly turned into a large green door handle. Hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him inside. He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high- ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing,“Harry Potter, sir! Harry Potter!” Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.“D- Dobby?” Harry gasped.“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel.“Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!” Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis- ball- shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness.

Ours are rather meek, I guess, compared to this… What do you call her?”“Her name is Mrs. Plithiver,” Soren said slowly and distinctly with the contempt in his voice poorly concealed.“Yes, yes,” the female replied nervously.“Well, we discourage our nest- maids from socially mingling with us at any time, really.”“That was hardly a party, what happened up there in the sky, ma’am,” Twilight said hotly.“Well, now tell me, young’uns,” said the male as if he was desperately trying to change the subject.“Where are you heading?

Soren felt that Gylfie’s question was a perfectly sensible one. What, indeed, was simple about in- visibleness?“Well, young’uns,” Swatums answered,“there is nothing simple. It’s just that it has been said that the Great Ga’Hoole Tree is invisible. That it grows on the island in the middle of a vast sea, a sea called Hoolemere that is nearly as wide as an ocean. A sea that is always wrapped in fog, an island feathered in blizzards, and a tree veiled in mist.”“So,” said Twilight,“it’s not really invisible, it’s just bad weather.”“Not exactly,” replied Swatums. Twilight cocked his head.“It seems that for some the fog lifts, the blizzards stop, and the mist blows away.”“For some?” asked Gylfie.“For those who believe.” Swatums paused and then sniffed in disdain.“But do they say what? Believe in what? No. You see, that is the problem. Owls with fancy ideas— ridiculous! That’s how you get into trouble. Sweetums and I don’t believe in fancy ideas.

They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait.” Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words“Ministry of Magic,”“wizards,” and“Muggles.” Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of menace in the cold voice now. A slight pause followed— and then Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.“It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord.” Another pause, more protracted, and then—“Without Harry Potter?” breathed the second voice softly.",Frank

She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved to see that she wasn’t giggling.“You— er— look nice,” he said awkwardly.“Thanks,” she said.“Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall,” she added to Ron.“Right,” said Ron, looking around.“Where’s Hermione?” Parvati shrugged.“Shall we go down then, Harry?”“Okay,” said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room.

Just then, like a shooting star, something red whizzed by.“Beautiful catch, Ruby,” shouted Poot.“What a natural that Short- eared Owl is!” Elvan gasped in amazement. Ruby began to wing off toward the coal buckets that Bubo had set up on the ridge. The small buckets made in his forge, with bits of kindling in the bottom already lit, would keep the coals hot.“All right, Martin going in!” Elvan called out the command. The little owl began a tight spiraling plunge to earth.“Cover him, Soren.” Soren would fly cover until Martin returned with a beakful of cinders. Elvan actually carried the very small cinder pot in his talons. Martin was supposed to not only collect cinders but report back on the larger coals that Soren and Otulissa were to retrieve.

Indeed, not only was he getting used to it but within the thunderous roar he could seek out smaller sounds, like the sound of Martin’s beating heart, which grew more rapid as he plunged.

Grinning faces could be seen under those that had their flaps open. Then, from behind them, they heard their names.“Harry! Ron! Hermione!” It was Seamus Finnigan, their fellow Gryffindor fourth year. He was sitting in front of his own shamrock- covered tent, with a sandy- haired woman who had to be his mother, and his best friend, Dean Thomas, also of Gryffindor.“Like the decorations?” said Seamus, grinning.“The Ministry’s not too happy.”“Ah, why shouldn’t we show our colors?” said Mrs. Finnigan.“You should see what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents.

She had said nothing. But now the Elf Owl stepped forward.“Are you trying to tell us we are not ready… that… that it takes more?”“Indeed. There is nothing that noble about slaughtering two bad owls in the desert.” The Spotted Owl rose up to her full height and looked down her beak at Gylfie. In a very haughty voice she said,“You have not been tempered by battle yet. Nor do you know the first thing about strategy. You probably don’t even know how to fly with battle claws. I have been here much longer than you and still have not yet become a member of a chaw.”“What’s a chaw?” Soren said.“You are selected to join a chaw— a small team of owls— and you will learn a skill that is helpful.”“In battle?” Twilight asked.“Not just battle— in life. There is more to life than just battles. Each chaw has its own, oh, how should I put it? Personality. Navigation chaw tends to have a kind of elegance, they are all superb flyers, as are the members of search- and- rescue, but they, of course, are less refined.

Their feathers were pulled, in tightly indications that the owls were very nervous about their first weather flight. When relaxed, an owl’s plumage is loose and fluffy. When angered, owls can puff up their feathers until they appear much, much larger. But now it was as if they had all become suddenly slim. The tension hovered in the air. Ezylryb fixed the young owls in the amber light of his squinted eye.“Eat up, maties… every single little hair. You’ve forgotten what raw meat tastes like with the fur, as you call it. Poot here is my first mate. He’ll tell you what it’s like to fly with no ballast in your gizzard.”“I remember that time before I had acquired the taste for hair and thought I could go through that hurricane. Last time I ever tried that. Nearly got caught in the rim of the eye, I did. Now, you don’t want to do that, young’uns.” Poot was a Boreal Owl like Soren and Gylfie’s old friend Grimble.“What happens if you get caught in the rim of the eye of a hurricane?” asked Rudy.“Oh, you spin around till you’re dead. Just around and around and around. Awful nasty way to go. Usually get your wings torn off in the process,” said Poot.“Now, don’t go scaring them, Poot,” Octavia said and gave a ripple so that all their plates clattered a bit.“And please, young’uns, don’t try that trick of slipping the fur under the table. Remember, I am the table and it itches something fierce.” It was not even dark yet, but the weather chaw owls were already on the takeoff limb",Poot
“What’s that you’re calling me?”,4966,4975,True,175:Frank.M,". Where are your manners?” The cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire, but Frank couldn’t see the speaker. The snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet dog. Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still deeply shaken, Frank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped over the threshold. The fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn’t even see the back of his head.“You heard everything, Muggle?” said the cold voice.“What’s that you’re calling me?” said Frank defiantly, for now that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war.“I am calling you a Muggle,” said the voice coolly.“It means that you are not a wizard.”“I don’t know what you mean by wizard,” said Frank, his voice growing steadier.“All I know is I’ve heard enough to interest the police tonight, I have. You’ve done murder and you’re planning more! And I’ll tell you this too,” he added, on a sudden inspiration,“my wife knows I’m up here, and if I don’t come back—”“You have no",Frank

Boron kept muttering,“Don’t be too hard on them, dear. They’re just youngsters. Young males do that kind of thing.”“Boron, I would like to point out that Primrose and Gylfie are not males.”“Oh, but I still know a lot of wet poop jokes,” Primrose tooted up. The air was laced with the soft churr sounds that owls make when they laugh. They were all churring except for Barran. Boron was churring the hardest. His big white fluffy body was shaking so hard that he shook loose a few wisps of down.“Really! Boron! It’s not a laughing matter,” his mate said in dismay.“But it is, my dear. That’s the point.” And he began to laugh even harder. The owls had already settled down for the day. It had been several hours since Madame Plonk had sung her lovely“Night Is Done” song and all had wished one another good light until the next night. But Soren had trouble falling asleep, and then he woke up in that slow time of the day for owls, when silence seems to press down over everything and the air is thick with sunlight and the minutes drag by. Time seemed to crawl and one wondered if there would ever be blackness again. Once more, Soren felt that melancholy feeling. He was not sure exactly what was causing it. He should be so",his mate

Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn’t believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he’d gotten through the first task, and he wouldn’t have to face the second one for three months.“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands.“Open it, Harry, go on! Let’s just see what’s inside it!”“He’s supposed to work out the clue on his own,” Hermione said swiftly.“It’s in the tournament rules.…”“I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too,” Harry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather guiltily.“Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!” several people echoed. Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open. It was hollow and completely empty— but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room.

You know why?” Otulissa’s talon shot up.“Because they are the shape of the seeds found in the Ga’Hoole fruits.”“Right- o, missy,” Ezylryb said. Martin gave a little sigh.“She never stops, does she?” It was clear that Martin was very nervous. More nervous than the others. Soren felt bad for him. He was the smallest owl in the chaw. It had to be scary.“Don’t worry, Martin. You’re going to be all right.”“Soren, that’s kind of you, but do you realize that I am the first Saw- whet to ever be in the colliering chaw?”“They must think you’re special, Martin,” Soren said.“But what if I’m not?” Martin said, a squeak of desperation creeping into his voice. Ezylryb continued speaking about the Ga’Hoole clouds.“The reason their tops are curved like that is because— well, you tell me.” Once again, Otulissa’s talon shot up.“It’s simple weather physics.

They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles’ cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested.“Frank!” cried several people.“Never!” Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener. He lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since. There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.“Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn’t.”“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar,“he had a hard war, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to—”“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked the cook.“There’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember!

I find it makes for rather temperamental wands… however, to each his own, and if this suits you…” Mr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for scratches or bumps; then he muttered,“Orchideous!” and a bunch of flowers burst from the wand tip.“Very well, very well, it’s in fine working order,” said Mr. Ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing them to Fleur with her wand.“Mr. Diggory, you next.” Fleur glided",Fleur

As he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons’ enclosure in November were now ranged along the opposite bank, rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below. The excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as Harry ran flat- out around the other side of the lake toward the judges, who were sitting at another gold- draped table at the water’s edge. Cedric, Fleur, and Krum were beside the judges’ table, watching Harry sprint toward them.“I’m… here…” Harry panted, skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally splattering Fleur’s robes.“Where have you been?” said a bossy, disapproving voice.“The task’s about to start!” Harry looked around.

You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus.

Hagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound, Fang. There were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet",Professor Sprout

There was a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely heard there before.“He thought I’d like this.” Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything. It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done. Harry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to the common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the coming month. An hour later, they had made very little progress, though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and Harry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney’s fire.“I haven’t got a clue what this lot’s supposed to mean,” he said, staring down at a long",Neville

Ron’s old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered Ron’s letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly.“Shut up, Pig,” said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room.“Fred and George are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,” he told Harry.“Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he’s got to work.”“Er— why are you calling that owl Pig?” Harry asked Ron.“Because he’s being stupid,” said Ginny.“Its proper name is Pigwidgeon.”“Yeah, and that’s not a stupid name at all,” said Ron sarcastically.“Ginny named him,” he explained to Harry.“She reckons it’s sweet. And I tried to change it, but it was too late, he won’t answer to anything else. So now he’s Pig. I’ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me too, come to that.” Pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly. Harry knew Ron too well to take him seriously.

Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge. Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn’t even got his letter? His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.“They need squeezing. You will collect the pus—”“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout,“and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This",Professor Sprout

Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone can not satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with both boys’ affections. Krum, who is openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has“never felt this way about any other girl.” However, it might not be Miss Granger’s doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys’ interest.“She’s really ugly,” says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourth- year student,“but she’d be well up to making a Love Potion, she’s quite brainy. I think that’s how she’s doing it.” Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims. In the meantime, Harry Potter’s well- wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate.“I told you!” Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article.“I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter! She’s made you out to be some sort of— of scarlet woman!” Hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter.“Scarlet woman?” she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at Ron.“It’s what my mum calls them,” Ron muttered, his ears going red.“If that’s the best Rita can do, she",Pansy Parkinson

Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels.“Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!” Dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor.“Dobby will be missed— good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!”“See you later, Dobby!” Harry shouted, and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three at a time.

Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered.“I told you… it was an accident.…”“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back.“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman… but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh?

You’ve passed it by. Overshot it by five hundred leagues.”“What! We flew over it and didn’t even see it?” Digger said, his voice barely audible.“Where are we exactly?” Gylfie asked.“You’re in the Ice Narrows, far side of Hoolemere, edge of the Northern Kingdoms.”“What!” All four owls gasped.“Don’t feel too dumb,” the male said.“Bad weather conditions.”“When do we ever have good ones, dear?” his mate mused.“Well, true. But with the wind coming from that direction, they just got sucked up into the Narrows and then that williwaw came.”“What’s a williwaw?”",the female

There she is!” Gylfie said.“Good old Ma,” Dumpy sighed.“Hope she brought some capelin. I just love capelin. If you don’t like it, will you give me yours? Please, please, please?”“Sure,” Soren said. Every minute that he stayed in this smelly hollow he was getting less hungry.“Look at that,” Twilight said.“How’s she going to get off?” The others now crowded to the edge of the ice hollow. Down below, it appeared that the female was trying to run across the surface of the water while madly flapping her wings.“Water takeoff— not easy for any of us. We’re not the best fliers, but, as you can see, we can dive. Got these little air pockets so we can go really deep for a long, long time. Getting back to the nest is the hardest part for us.” The male stepped out of the ice hollow and called down.“Dearest, try that patch over there under the lee, the water is smoother.” She gave her mate a withering glance, and somehow through the mouthful of fish yelled back,“You want me to fly directly into the wall, Puff Head! There’s a tailwind. I’ll slam beak- first into it. Then where will your dinner be? If you’re so smart you come down and go fishing yourself.”“Oh, sorry, dear, silly me.” Then he turned to the owls.“We’re really not that bright. I mean we dive well, know how to fish, and deal with ice, but that’s about it.” But, in fact",the female
"“Beautiful catch,",51663,51669,True,219:Poot.?,"’s always a shock at first. There is no way to describe it.” He had to shout over the roar of the fire. Below, a sheet of flame lay flat against a hillside. The thermal drafts came up like slabs of rock. Martin and Soren were sucked up at least twenty feet but as they passed the hill they felt a terrific coolness and they dropped another thirty feet. Soren realized that it was only cool compared to the heat they had just flown through. Bubo now circled back. He had been flying far out in front.“Good ember beds ahead. Perfect for all of you.” So this was it, Soren thought. This was when they became true colliers. Just then, like a shooting star, something red whizzed by.“Beautiful catch, Ruby,” shouted Poot.“What a natural that Short- eared Owl is!” Elvan gasped in amazement. Ruby began to wing off toward the coal buckets that Bubo had set up on the ridge. The small buckets made in his forge, with bits of kindling in the bottom already lit, would keep the coals hot.“All right, Martin going in!” Elvan called out the command. The little owl began a tight spiraling plunge to earth.“Cover him, Soren.” Soren would fly cover until Martin returned with a beakful of cinders. Elvan actually carried the very small cinder pot in his talons. Martin was supposed to not only collect cinders but report back on the larger coals that Soren and Otulissa were to retrieve. Soren hovered above with a careful eye",Poot

And I think you know his son, Cedric?” Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He was Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.“Hi,” said Cedric, looking around at them all. Everybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nodded. They had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, Gryffindor, in the first Quidditch match of the previous year.“Long walk, Arthur?” Cedric’s father asked.“Not too bad,” said Mr. Weasley.“We live just on the other side of the village there. You?”“Had to get up at two, didn’t we, Ced? I tell you, I’ll be glad when he’s got his Apparition test. Still… not complaining… Quidditch World Cup, wouldn’t miss it for a sackful of Galleons— and the tickets cost about that. Mind you, looks like I got off easy.…” Amos Diggory peered good- naturedly around at the three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny.“All these yours, Arthur?”“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children.“This is Hermione, friend of Ron’s— and Harry, another friend—”“Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening.“Harry? Harry Potter?”“Er— yeah,” said Harry.

About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming— a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature. He winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim opened wide—“GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted. Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey, beaming widely, took off the hat, placed it back on the stool, and hurried over to join his brother.“Colin, I fell in!” he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty seat.“It was brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!”“Cool!” said Colin, just as excitedly.“It was probably the giant squid, Dennis!”“Wow!” said Dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a storm- tossed, fathoms- deep lake, and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster.“Dennis!

"Never wanted to mix,",830,864,True,665:the cook.?,"; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders. They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles’ cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested.“Frank!” cried several people.“Never!” Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener. He lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since. There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.“Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn’t.”“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar,“he had a hard war, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to—”“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked the cook.“There’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember! Nobody forced the door last night! No broken windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping.…” The villagers exchanged dark looks.“I always thought he had a nasty look about him, right enough,” grunted a man at the bar.“War turned him funny, if you ask me,” said the landlord.“",the cook

A cloud of smoke temporarily obscured him and Soren flew lower. There he was! There he was! Good heavens, he was coming up fast!“He’s coming in loaded!” Bubo slid in next to Elvan. And then he was there. Cinders poured from his small beak. His face was sooty and smudged but his eyes danced with a light as bright as the fire.“I did it! I did it!”“You certainly did, young’un.” Bubo flew up and tousled Martin’s head feathers with his talon.“I can’t wait to go back,” Martin shouted.“Hold on there,” Elvan said.“First, your report.”“Embers about the size of pellets uphill from where I landed.”“Excellent,” Elvan said. Elvan then flew off to confer with Bubo and Ezylryb.“Soren, there is nothing like it. I can’t tell you. As soon as I got there I just wasn’t frightened at all. And I can’t describe what it’s like to grab the cinders in your beak. It’s…”“Intoxicating,” Otulissa broke in.“Yes, I read about it. You must be careful, though.

When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto Dudley’s plate with a tremulous“There you are, Diddy darling,” Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end- of- year report. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn’t understand him, while Uncle Vernon maintained that“he didn’t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway.” They also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report—“He’s a boisterous little boy, but he wouldn’t hurt a fly!” Aunt Petunia had said tearfully. However, at the bottom of the report there were a few well- chosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain away. No matter how much Aunt Petunia wailed that Dudley was big- boned, and that his poundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the school outfitters didn’t stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore. The school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia’s eyes— so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors— simply refused to see: that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer",Aunt Petunia

He’s unbelievable. He’s really young too. Only just eighteen or something. He’s a genius, you wait until tonight, you’ll see.” There was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field. Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument. One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown. The other was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.“Just put them on, Archie, there’s a good chap. You can’t walk around like that, the Muggle at the gate’s already getting suspicious—”“I bought this in a Muggle shop,” said the old wizard stubbornly.“Muggles wear them.”“Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they wear these,” said the Ministry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped trousers.“I’m not putting them on,” said old Archie in indignation.“I like a healthy breeze’ round my privates, thanks.” Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away. Walking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made their way back through the campsite. Here and there, they saw more familiar faces: other Hogwarts",the other

Will you come now?”“I’ve already told you!” Hermione said very angrily.“I’m going with someone else!” And she stormed off toward the girls’ dormitories again.“She’s lying,” said Ron flatly, watching her go.“She’s not,” said Ginny quietly.“Who is it then?” said Ron sharply.“I’m not telling you, it’s her business,” said Ginny.“Right,” said Ron, who looked extremely put out,“this is getting stupid.

She completely disappeared beneath the surface. Soren had been joined by Twilight, Digger, and Gylfie at the edge of the nest. They waited and waited, then looked at one another.“Sir,” Gylfie began,“I think something might have happened to your mate… uh… er… She dove into the sea and no sign of her yet.”“Oh, she’ll be a while.

Their feathers were pulled, in tightly indications that the owls were very nervous about their first weather flight. When relaxed, an owl’s plumage is loose and fluffy. When angered, owls can puff up their feathers until they appear much, much larger. But now it was as if they had all become suddenly slim. The tension hovered in the air. Ezylryb fixed the young owls in the amber light of his squinted eye.“Eat up, maties… every single little hair. You’ve forgotten what raw meat tastes like with the fur, as you call it.

He was quite looking forward to it.

A sleeve of Ron’s dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious.

I mean— they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety.…”“Eat dung, Malfoy!” said Ron, the same color as the dress robes as he snatched them back out of Malfoy’s grip. Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.“So… going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name? There’s money involved as well, you know… you’d be able to afford some decent robes if you won.…”“What are you talking about?” snapped Ron.“Are you going to enter?” Malfoy repeated.“I suppose you will, Potter? You never miss a chance to show off, do you?”“Either explain what you’re on about or go away, Malfoy,” said Hermione testily, over the top of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4.

I can’t imagine what it does to the air. I mean, flying through it must be almost impossible. You could never even half guess where the dead falls might be.”“Technically, the fire does that”—Otulissa had caught up with them—“because the fire climbs what is called, according to the literature, a fuel ladder.”“Yes, and think of me,” Martin now spoke.“I am on the ground, supposedly looking for the smallest embers. One of these crowning things happens, and at my weight I get sucked straight up the fuel ladder.”“We all have to spend time on the ground, not just you,” Soren said.“It could happen to any of us. You don’t have to be little.” Martin cocked his head and blinked. He did not look convinced. Although they had yet to be in an actual forest fire, each member of the chaw had a type of coal or ember they were in charge of gathering. Ruby, being the best flier, would seek airborne embers that were dispersed to the highest parts of the thermal draft columns. Soren and Otulissa were assigned a midpoint position on various sides of the convection column and little Martin was on the ground.

Harry saw some of the panic he’d been feeling since Saturday night flickering in Cedric’s gray eyes.“Are you sure?” Cedric said in a hushed voice.“Dead sure,” said Harry.“I’ve seen them.”“But how did you find out? We’re not supposed to know.…”“Never mind,” said Harry quickly— he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth.“But I’m not the only one who knows. Fleur and Krum will know by now— Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too.” Cedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills, parchment, and books, his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder.

He had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady,“Violet’s just told me everything. Who’s just been chosen as school champion, then?”“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly.“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room. The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.“You should’ve told us you’d entered!",the Fat Lady

Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn’t even see the back of his head.“You heard everything, Muggle?” said the cold voice.“What’s that you’re calling me?” said Frank defiantly, for now that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war.“I am calling you a Muggle,” said the voice coolly.“It means that you are not a wizard.”“I don’t know what you mean by wizard,” said Frank, his voice growing steadier.“All I know is I’ve heard enough to interest the police tonight, I have. You’ve done murder and you’re planning more! And I’ll tell you this too,” he added, on a sudden inspiration,“my wife knows I’m up here, and if I don’t come back—”“You have no wife,” said the cold voice, very quietly.“Nobody knows you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows… he always knows.…”“Is that right?” said Frank roughly.“Lord, is it? Well, I don’t think much of your manners, My Lord.

Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered.“I told you… it was an accident.…”“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back.“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman… but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays on, you don’t need to be a genius to tell which one’s the better flier!”“Must be nearly time,” said Mr. Weasley quickly, pulling out his watch again.“Do you know whether we’re waiting for any more, Amos?”“No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts couldn’t get tickets,” said Mr. Diggory.“There aren’t any more of us in this area, are there?”“Not that I know of,” said Mr. Weasley.“Yes, it’s a minute off.… We’d better get ready.…” He looked around at Harry and Hermione.“You just need to touch the Portkey, that’s all, a finger will do—” With difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the nine of them crowded around the old boot held",Amos Diggory

Harry heard people gasping, screaming, and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them, taking him back to the castle. Across the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship, Harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk.“What happened, Harry?” the man asked at last as he lifted Harry up the stone steps.

Never heard such a bunch of babble in my life.” It was Elsie, a rather bunchy- looking Barred Owl, who seemed to have more feathers than her small body could manage. The bar designs on her wings had almost faded into a blur. But she was a kindly old bird, who, along with Matron, was in charge of the care and feeding of all the newly arrived young owlets at the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. Never before had the two owls been actually brought out to a gathering station on a search- and- rescue mission, however.“Over here, Twilight,” Matron called.“I have just fluffed up a place. That Sooty will fit in nicely. Elsie dear, spare me a bit more down for this Sooty.” Elsie obliged by plucking out some downy fluff from beneath her primaries. Twilight blinked. It was just as Elsie said. A low babble came in a steady stream from the little owlets, and they were all reciting some kind of poetry, and it made absolutely no sense to Twilight. One little Grass Owl was now chanting in a thin little voice,“Tytos now forever, so pure, so rare! Yet supreme!” A Masked Owl spoke of a Tyto to whom righteousness belonged and still another was crying out,“Oh, Tyto, who is pureness beyond compare, show thyself… Tyto, how long shall the impure triumph?”“Depressing little ditties, aren’t they?” Bubo said as he lighted down next to Twilight.“What are they talking",Matron

You’ve passed it by. Overshot it by five hundred leagues.”“What! We flew over it and didn’t even see it?” Digger said, his voice barely audible.“Where are we exactly?” Gylfie asked.“You’re in the Ice Narrows, far side of Hoolemere, edge of the Northern Kingdoms.”“What!” All four owls gasped.“Don’t feel too dumb,” the male said.“Bad weather conditions.”“When do we ever have good ones, dear?” his mate mused.“Well, true. But with the wind coming from that direction, they just got sucked up into the Narrows and then that williwaw came.”“What’s a williwaw?” Soren asked.“You get a big tumble, like an avalanche.

Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw table, where everyone was applauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down. For a fleeting second, Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.“Baddock, Malcolm!”“SLYTHERIN!” The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins. Harry wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other. Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down.“Branstone, Eleanor!”“HUFFLEPUFF!”“Cauldwell, Owen!”“HUFFLEPUFF!”“Creevey, Dennis!” Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid’s moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers’ table. About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming— a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature. He winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim opened wide—“GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted. Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey, beaming widely, took off",Baddock

I think we got ourselves a G- flat!” CHAPTER TWENTY Fire! Ezylryb perched on a limb at the very top of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree and squinted into the blueness of the early summer day. He had been perched here for the last two days almost continuously with Poot by his side. They were studying the cloud behavior on the far side of Hoole- mere.“Bring the chaw up,” he ordered tersely.“There’s enough for them to observe.”“What! What!” Soren yawned sleepily as Poot shook him awake.“It’s the middle of the day, Poot. We’re supposed to be sleeping.”“Not now, young’un. Important lesson, top of the tree. Cap wants you there now. Quick- o!” What could it be? Soren thought. Poot only called Ezylryb“Cap” when they were on a flight mission. But there wasn’t any bad weather. It was a calm, perfectly clear day. It was the time of the golden rain, when the strands of Ga’Hoole berries that hung from the limbs turned a rich yellow. By the time Soren got to the top limb, the others had assembled— albeit sleepily. Martin was yawning into the morning sun, but Otulissa was alert and full of questions and already peppering the air with her observations of cloud formations. Ruby yarped her morning pellet and looked to Soren as if she was so",Poot
"Harry,",57623,57643,True,361:Colin.M,"that his head didn’t wobble too much on his partially severed neck.“Good evening,” he said, beaming at them.“Says who?” said Harry, taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water.“Hope they hurry up with the Sorting. I’m starving.” The Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn’t been present at one since his own. He was quite looking forward to it. Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.“Hiya, Harry!” It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s starting! My brother Dennis!”“Er— good,” said Harry.“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat.“I just hope he’s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?”“Er— yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick.“Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor.“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione.“Parvati Patil’s twin’s in Ravenclaw, and they’re identical. You’d think they’d be together, wouldn’t you?” Harry looked up at",Colin

Could this little owl be Eglantine?“They will think that you were a brave little Pygmy Owl,” Matron replied. Soren sighed.“What are you doing out there? Just don’t stand around, come in and make yourself useful,” Matron called. Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably. A bunchy Barred Owl poked her head in.“Any tea here?”“Oh, yes, I think a cup of milkberry tea would be lovely.”“I dropped the egg. I don’t deserve to live.” Primrose emitted a long sound halfway",Matron

This was the most distinctive feature of Barn Owls, and he really did not want to think of it growing singed and sooty. Maybe he was vain but he couldn’t help it.“Pay attention! Soren!” Elvan barked.“You nearly ran into Otulissa.” Thank Glaux she couldn’t speak, thought Soren. That was the only good thing about colliering. It was hard to speak with a live coal in one’s mouth. So Otulissa was effectively shut up for once.“All right, rest time. Drop your coals,” Elvan announced. Rest wasn’t really rest, however, as the ryb lectured them the entire time.“Tomorrow you shall begin flying with the coals in your beaks. It is not that different, really, from walking. Although you must take care to keep your coal alive and burning.”“Yeah!” Bubo boomed.“Dead coals ain’t going to do me a bit of good, young’uns. No sense flying in here with a great lot of ashes, cold as Glaux knows what.”“Yes,” continued Elvan.“We don’t want to disappoint Bubo.”“Oh, Glaux forbid that we should disappoint Bubo,” Otulissa mumbled. Soren stole a glance at her. There was pure venom in her eyes. Why couldn’t she just be angry about being in this chaw? What did Bubo have to do with it? Soren thought. He knew why, of course. Otulissa thought she was too good to have anything to do with Bubo. Neither Bubo nor any of the owls in this chaw had the distinguished background of",the ryb

It was as if every single one of his hollow bones, every feather shaft brimmed with this feeling of transcendent power. Joy filled him, a joy such as he had never felt since perhaps the first time he had ever flown. But how he got this coal was still a mystery to him. He flew back to the ridge where the buckets were. Martin was beside him.“You were spectacular, Soren. I was so nervous when I saw that crown fire break and then when we saw you getting sucked up, I nearly went yeep.”“But what happened?” Soren asked. They were to stay on the ridge until the rest of the chaw returned.“You mean to tell me you don’t know?”“Not exactly.”“You did a reverse loop to escape the pull and as you were coming out of it this coal flew by. Bubo said he never saw a coal of that size go up so high, but you caught it! Caught it on the loop, Soren. I mean it was better flying than anything Ruby has ever done. It was absolutely spectacular.”“Great Glaux, I wish I’d seen it,” Soren said. Martin hooted loudly.“You did it, Soren! You did it!” Otulissa flew in next with Ruby and Poot. She had a full beak and dumped the coals into the bucket.“I got one! I got one!” And then she stopped and looked up, genuinely modest now.“But, Soren, it is nothing compared to what you did.”“Well, thank you, Otulissa… er… uh… That is very kind of you.” Otulissa bobbed her head and actually said nothing for once. Martin blinked at Soren as if to say,“I wonder how long that will last?” Soren looked about for Ezylryb. He wondered if Ezyl",Martin

Harry sighed.“Can’t you think of anyone who’d go with Ron?” he said, lowering his voice so that Ron wouldn’t hear.“What about Hermione Granger?” said Parvati.“She’s going with someone else.” Parvati looked astonished.“Ooooh— who?” she said keenly. Harry shrugged.“No idea,” he said.“So what about Ron?”“Well…” said Parvati slowly,“I suppose my sister might… Padma, you know… in Ravenclaw. I’ll ask her if you like.”“Yeah, that would be great,” said Harry.“Let me know, will you?” And he went back over to Ron, feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth, and hoping very much that Padma Patil’s nose was dead center. Chapter 23 The Yule Ball Despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given for the holidays, Harry was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent the week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone else. Gryffindor Tower was hardly less crowded now than during term- time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual.

Harry knew Ron had been about to ask about Sirius. Ron and Hermione had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry’s godfather as he was. However, discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad idea. Nobody but themselves and Professor Dumbledore knew about how Sirius had escaped, or believed in his innocence.“I think they’ve stopped arguing,” said Hermione, to cover the awkward moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry.“Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner?”“Yeah, all right,” said Ron. The four of them left Ron’s room and went back downstairs to find Mrs. Weasley alone in the kitchen, looking extremely bad- tempered.“We’re eating out in the garden,” she said when they came in.“There’s just not room for eleven people in here. Could you take the plates outside, girls? Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables. Knives and forks, please, you two,” she said to Ron and Harry, pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling.“Oh for heaven’s sake,” she snapped, now",Ginny

As he walked through the Slytherin desks, POTTER STINKS flashed at him from every direction.“It’s amazing, isn’t it, Harry?” said Colin, starting to speak the moment Harry had closed the dungeon door behind him.“Isn’t it, though?

And then added.“Good light, Mrs. Plithiver.” But Mrs. Plithiver was already sound asleep. CHAPTER NINE A Parliament of Owls The four owls were in the antechamber of another hollow called the parliament. They were waiting to be admitted for their meeting with Boron and Barran.“Very important business inside, young’uns,” an owl on guard spoke in the soft tings of a Boreal Owl.“We won’t take long,” Gylfie said. I hope not, thought Soren. He was frightened. The other three had decided that he should be the one to speak. Another owl stuck her head out.“You can come in now. But be quiet and wait your turn.” She indicated a branch where they should perch. Soren looked about. It was not an especially large hollow, not nearly as big as the one in which they had first been welcomed by Boron and Barran. There were candles, of course, and there was one long white branch from a tree that Soren thought was called a birch that had been bent into a half circle. It was on this white branch that the owls of the parliament, no more than a dozen, perched. He recognized the elderly Strix Struma, the Spotted Owl he had met the night before. She perched next to a Great Horned Owl of an unusual ruddy color with even more unusual very black talons. Then there was an ancient and decrepit Whiskered Screech, who appeared to have the worst case of",another owl

Once you start a fire going, wouldn’t there always be new coals?” This was some smart little owl, Soren thought. Why hadn’t the others thought of this question? Why were new coals from a new fire needed? Elvan turned to Bubo.“Bubo, as chief smith, would you care to answer that?”“Sure thing, mate.” Then he stepped up to Martin and, towering over him, began to speak.“A very good question. You are right, it is very possible to keep fires going forever and that is fine for some things— things like cooking and warming up a hollow. But for certain tasks, especially certain metalwork in the forge, we need new fresh coals that have been born of sparking trees full of sap. They become the blood of our hottest fires. Then again, we need a variety of coals. Certain coals from certain trees last longer. That’s how a fire gets bonk.”“What’s bonk?” asked Martin.“Ah, it’s an old smithy term. Hard to explain unless you’ve been working",Elvan
“And so?”,23911,23915,True,172:Barran.F,"right way to start,” Gylfie had said. Of course, Soren hadn’t known what fratricide was until Gylfie explained it meant killing your brother. Then he agreed with her. He certainly didn’t want the owls of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree to think he came from such a murderous family. Kludd was the only one, after all.“I was snatched by a St. Aggie’s patrol. It was at St. Aggie’s that I met Gylfie.” It was difficult at first to speak and not look at Ezylryb’s mangled foot, but as he spoke, Soren became more relaxed. The owls seemed attentive but not particularly impressed, not even when he told them about Hortense and that it was not simply starvation that was accounting for the low egg counts in Ambala.“And so?” Barran said when Soren appeared to have concluded.“And so what?” Soren asked.“What is it you want, dear?”“The four of us are a band. We have flown together, fought together, and escaped many dangers— as a band. We know from our experience that there is great evil that threatens every owl in every owl kingdom on earth. We want only to fight this evil, to become guardian knights of this order.” He saw Ezylryb stifle a yawn and pick up what appeared to be a dried caterpillar to munch.“We feel that we have special knowledge. We have much to offer,” Soren concluded.“I am sure you do,” said Boron.“Every owl here has special knowledge and,",Barran
“A fire— forest fire.,21249,21299,True,685:the little owl.F,". Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably. A bunchy Barred Owl poked her head in.“Any tea here?”“Oh, yes, I think a cup of milkberry tea would be lovely.”“I dropped the egg. I don’t deserve to live.” Primrose emitted a long sound halfway between a whistle and a wail.“Don’t say that!” Soren exclaimed.“Of course you deserve to live. Every owl deserves to live. That’s why we came here.” Matron stopped what she was doing and cocked her head and regarded the young Barn Owl. Perhaps he was learning; just perhaps he was beginning to catch a glimmer of the true meaning of a noble deed. She would leave him to comfort this little Pygmy Owl and",the little owl

The doctors did note(as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face— but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death? As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while. To everyone’s surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.“’S far as I’m concerned, he killed them, and I don’t care what the police say,” said Dot in the Hanged Man.“And if he had any decency, he’d leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.” But Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next— for neither family stayed long. Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair. The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for“tax reasons,” though nobody was very clear what these might be.

Soren felt that Gylfie’s question was a perfectly sensible one. What, indeed, was simple about in- visibleness?“Well, young’uns,” Swatums answered,“there is nothing simple. It’s just that it has been said that the Great Ga’Hoole Tree is invisible. That it grows on the island in the middle of a vast sea, a sea called Hoolemere that is nearly as wide as an ocean. A sea that is always wrapped in fog, an island feathered in blizzards, and a tree veiled in mist.”“So,” said Twilight,“it’s not really invisible, it’s just bad weather.”“Not exactly,” replied Swatums. Twilight cocked his head.“It seems that for some the fog lifts, the blizzards stop, and the mist blows away.”“For some?” asked Gylfie.“For those who believe.” Swatums paused and then sniffed in disdain.“But do they say what? Believe in what? No. You see, that is the problem. Owls with fancy ideas— ridiculous! That’s how you get into trouble. Sweetums and I don’t believe in fancy ideas.

A sleeve of Ron’s dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious. Ron made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy was too quick for him; he seized the sleeve and pulled.“Look at this!” said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron’s robes and showing Crabbe and Goyle,“Weasley, you weren’t thinking of wearing these, were you? I mean— they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety.…”“Eat dung, Malfoy!” said Ron, the same color as the dress robes as he snatched them back out of Malfoy’s grip. Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.“So… going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name? There’s money involved as well, you know… you’d be able to afford some decent robes if you won.…”“What are you talking about?” snapped Ron.“Are you going to enter?” Malfoy repeated.“I suppose you will, Potter?

It was all hushed up, though. But he’s made friends with werewolves and giants too. We think he’d do anything for a bit of power.” Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a Dark Art. Indeed, the most famous Parselmouth of our times is none other than You- Know- Who himself. A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue“as worthy of investigation. Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with evildoers.” Similarly,“anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence.” Albus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the Triwizard Tournament.

Well, I never!” Soren decided to skip visiting Mrs. P. He knew what he must do. He must“drop by” Madame Plonk’s, and he must tell her that here was a very special snake, a snake that had something even finer than a gizzard, a snake of the highest— what was that word Mrs. P. was always using?—“Sensibilities, artistic sensibilities.” CHAPTER NINETEEN A Visit to Madame Plonk You see, Madame Plonk, I know that perhaps this is not proper— me coming to you this way.” Soren could hardly keep his mind on what he was saying, as he had never in his life seen a hollow like this one. The air spun with colored light from the whirlyglasses that hung from the ceiling and sometimes jutted out from the walls, suspended on twigs jammed into cracks. There were several openings through which light poured. There were pieces of cloth embroidered with beautiful designs and one little niche spilled over with strands of luminous beads. Indeed, the hollow seemed to swirl with color. And in the middle of all this color there was a dazzling whiteness— Madame Plonk. Soren gulped and tried to keep his eyes from straying from that whiteness.“But I just know that Mrs. P. is rather shy and would never dare.”“Mrs. P.?” Madame Plonk broke in.“I don’t believe I know this snake.”“She came with me, ma’am. She’s my family’s old nest- maid snake.”“Oh, and you were saying that she wants to be in the harp guild?”“Yes, ma’am.” Soren thought he sounded so stupid. Who cares? he thought.

There were not many rules at the Great Ga’Hoole Tree but, as Matron instructed the young owls, there were to be no wet poop jokes anywhere, and especially not in the dining hollow. Therefore, the nest snakes were under orders, if it was teatime and they were serving, to immediately dismiss the culprits, and this was accomplished in just the manner Mrs. P. had done when she shook herself. They were ordered to go see Boron and Barran. As could be expected, Barran scolded them and told them that their behavior was shocking.“Poor form,” she called it. Boron kept muttering,“Don’t be too hard on them, dear. They’re just youngsters. Young males do that kind of thing.”“Boron, I would like to point out that Primrose and Gylfie are not males.”“Oh, but I still know a lot of wet poop jokes,” Primrose tooted up. The air was laced with the soft churr sounds that owls make when they laugh. They were all churring except for Barran. Boron was churring the hardest.

Just a nice little beginning fire with a good mix of trees— Ga’Hooles, firs, pine, some soft and hard woods. Not too many ridges or mountains to complicate wind patterns.”“Pardon me,” piped up the little Northern Saw- whet Owl, Martin, who had been rescued the same night as Primrose.“Yes, Martin,” Elvan said.“Well, I don’t understand why we need new coals all the time. Once you start a fire going, wouldn’t there always be new coals?” This was some smart little owl, Soren thought. Why hadn’t the others thought of this question? Why were new coals from a new fire needed? Elvan turned to Bubo.“Bubo, as chief smith, would you care to answer that?”“Sure thing, mate.” Then he stepped up to Martin and, towering over him, began to speak.“A very good question. You are right",Elvan

It gives you a lot of control and you can ride the waves,” Ezylryb called back. Finally, Otulissa arrived, sputtering with rage and talking about a report that she was going to make about“this outrageous activity.”“Oh, shut your beak!” Poot screeched at her. And then they skidded and spun, doing what was called the hurly- burly. In the scuppers, Ezylryb began to squawk a raucous ditty into the teeth of the gale. We are the owls of the weather chaw.

She’s always going on about how I should be upholding the family honor. I’ll just have to— oops.…” Neville’s foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase. There were many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts; it was second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step, but Neville’s memory was notoriously poor. Harry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.“Shut it, you,” said Ron, banging down its visor as they passed.

After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon. They said good- bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door. A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents.

If Cedric had been outside the time limit, he most certainly had been.“Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration, which was nevertheless effective, and was second to return with his hostage.

It was hollow and completely empty— but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room.

Krum, who is openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has“never felt this way about any other girl.” However, it might not be Miss Granger’s doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys’ interest.“She’s really ugly,” says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourth- year student,“but she’d be well up to making a Love Potion, she’s quite brainy.

It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail.” Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse— with amusement. He was dangerous— a madman. And he was planning more murders— this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was— was in danger— Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village… but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.“One more murder… my faithful servant at Hogwarts…",the second man

The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for Bagman, their faces full of savage triumph. The boy began to scream.“No! Mother, no! I didn’t do it, I didn’t do it, I didn’t know! Don’t send me there, don’t let him!” The dementors were gliding back into the room. The boys’ three companions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy- lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called,“The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban; we will wait! He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!” But the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though Harry could see their cold, draining power starting to affect him. The crowd was jeering, some of them on their feet, as the woman swept out of the dungeon, and the boy continued to struggle.“I’m your son!” he",the boy

It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady,“Violet’s just told me everything. Who’s just been chosen as school champion, then?”“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly.“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room. The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred; he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed.“How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!” roared George.“I didn’t,” Harry said.“I don’t know how—” But Angelina had now swooped down upon him;“Oh if it",the Fat Lady
Dennis!”,59311,59321,True,361:Colin.M,", looked slightly alarming— a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature. He winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim opened wide—“GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted. Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey, beaming widely, took off the hat, placed it back on the stool, and hurried over to join his brother.“Colin, I fell in!” he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty seat.“It was brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!”“Cool!” said Colin, just as excitedly.“It was probably the giant squid, Dennis!”“Wow!” said Dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a storm- tossed, fathoms- deep lake, and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster.“Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one with the black hair and glasses? See him? Know who he is, Dennis?” Harry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now Sorting Emma Dobbs. The Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to the three- legged stool, the line dwindling slowly as Professor McGonagall passed the L’s.“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.“Now, Ron, the Sorting",Colin

I’ll just hang here, wide open, until you get back, shall I?”“Yeah, thanks!” Ron shouted over his shoulder.“Hermione, where are we going?” Harry asked, after she had led them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.“You’ll see, you’ll see in a minute!” said Hermione excitedly. She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and Harry’s names. Harry had never been through here before. He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape’s dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with torches",the Fat Lady
Otulissa.,31158,31169,True,1537:young ones.?,".” Soren wondered if he would ever have the nerve to just”drop by” Madame Plonk’s for a cup oftea. What would he ever have to say to such a beautiful and elegant owl? Flying was one thing, but sitting and talking was another. Soren saw dozens of rosy- scaled blind snakes crawling up to the hollow where the harp was kept. Soon the Great Ga’Hoole Tree would begin to awake and stir to the lovely harmonies of Evensong. For twilight was upon them. CHAPTER THIRTEEN Books of the Yonder Now, young ones, please follow me as we explore the wondrous root structure of our dear tree. You see where the roots bump up from the ground.” It was the Ga’Hoolology ryb, a boring old Burrowing Owl.“Here’s one.”“Oh, yes, Otulissa. A perfect example.”“Here’s one,” Gylfie mimicked Otulissa.“She has the most annoying voice.”“Now if we can find a pellet or if someone would care to yarp one, I shall demonstrate the proper burying technique. Pellets properly buried nourish the tree,” the ryb continued.“Oh, I’ll find you one,” Otulissa quickly volunteered and bustled off.“This is the most borrring class,” sighed Soren. They had been stomping around the base of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree all during twilight.“I don’t think it’s that bad,” said Digger. Digger, of course, being a Burrowing Owl, preferred ground activities.“I don’t know what I’ll do if I am tapped for Ga’Hoolol- ogy,” Twilight muttered",young ones
"indeed,",131952,131959,True,2112:the Fat Lady.F,"Cedric Diggory.”“Oh right,” said Harry. His insides had come back again. It felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence. Completely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to Gryffindor Tower, Cho’s voice echoing in his ears with every step he took.“Cedric— Cedric Diggory.” He had been starting to quite like Cedric— prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at Quidditch, and was handsome, and popular, and nearly everyone’s favorite champion. Now he suddenly realized that Cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who didn’t have enough brains to fill an eggcup.“Fairy lights,” he said dully to the Fat Lady— the password had been changed the previous day.“Yes, indeed, dear!” she trilled, straightening her new tinsel hair band as she swung forward to admit him. Entering the common room, Harry looked around, and to his surprise he saw Ron sitting ashen- faced in a distant corner. Ginny was sitting with him, talking to him in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice.“What’s up, Ron?” said Harry, joining them. Ron looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his face.“Why did I do it?” he said wildly.“I don’t know what made me do it!”“What?” said Harry.“He— er— just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him,” said Ginny.

"Nearly got caught in the rim of the eye,",43201,43255,True,219:Poot.?,"the young owls in the weather chaw seemed to have diminished in size. Their feathers were pulled, in tightly indications that the owls were very nervous about their first weather flight. When relaxed, an owl’s plumage is loose and fluffy. When angered, owls can puff up their feathers until they appear much, much larger. But now it was as if they had all become suddenly slim. The tension hovered in the air. Ezylryb fixed the young owls in the amber light of his squinted eye.“Eat up, maties… every single little hair. You’ve forgotten what raw meat tastes like with the fur, as you call it. Poot here is my first mate. He’ll tell you what it’s like to fly with no ballast in your gizzard.”“I remember that time before I had acquired the taste for hair and thought I could go through that hurricane. Last time I ever tried that. Nearly got caught in the rim of the eye, I did. Now, you don’t want to do that, young’uns.” Poot was a Boreal Owl like Soren and Gylfie’s old friend Grimble.“What happens if you get caught in the rim of the eye of a hurricane?” asked Rudy.“Oh, you spin around till you’re dead. Just around and around and around. Awful nasty way to go. Usually get your wings torn off in the process,” said Poot.“Now, don’t go scaring them, Poot,” Octavia said and gave a ripple so that all their plates clattered a bit.“And please, young’uns, don’t try that trick of slipping the fur under the table. Remember, I am the table and it itches something fierce.” It was not even dark yet, but the weather chaw owls were already on the takeoff limb",Poot
There’s a tailwind.,15409,15457,True,325:the female.F,"going to get off?” The others now crowded to the edge of the ice hollow. Down below, it appeared that the female was trying to run across the surface of the water while madly flapping her wings.“Water takeoff— not easy for any of us. We’re not the best fliers, but, as you can see, we can dive. Got these little air pockets so we can go really deep for a long, long time. Getting back to the nest is the hardest part for us.” The male stepped out of the ice hollow and called down.“Dearest, try that patch over there under the lee, the water is smoother.” She gave her mate a withering glance, and somehow through the mouthful of fish yelled back,“You want me to fly directly into the wall, Puff Head! There’s a tailwind. I’ll slam beak- first into it. Then where will your dinner be? If you’re so smart you come down and go fishing yourself.”“Oh, sorry, dear, silly me.” Then he turned to the owls.“We’re really not that bright. I mean we dive well, know how to fish, and deal with ice, but that’s about it.” But, in fact, the puffins knew more and were not that dumb at all.“Just low self- esteem,” Gylfie said. The puffins, in addition to knowing how to dive and fish, knew weather. And just now they were telling them that there would be a small pocket of time when the wind would turn, and they could leave before the next storm came in.“You see, young’uns,” said the male puffin,“nine days out often, the wind slams full force up",the female
Why was she so upset at breakfast?”,180782,180801,True,453:Pansy Parkinson.F,"cradling her hands.“I warned her not to annoy Rita Skeeter! Look at this one…” He read out one of the letters Hermione had left behind:“‘ I read in Witch Weekly about how you are playing Harry Potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and I will be sending you a curse by next post as soon as I can find a big enough envelope.’ Blimey, she’d better watch out for herself.” Hermione didn’t turn up for Herbology. As Harry and Ron left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle. Pansy Parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of Slytherin girls. Catching sight of Harry, Pansy called,“Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend? Why was she so upset at breakfast?” Harry ignored her; he didn’t want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused. Hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns, was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet. Harry’s heart sank at the sight of the crates— surely not another skrewt hatching?— but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number of fluffy black creatures with long snouts. Their front paws were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention.“These’re nifflers,” said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around.“Yeh find’em down mines",Pansy Parkinson

You’ve done murder and you’re planning more! And I’ll tell you this too,” he added, on a sudden inspiration,“my wife knows I’m up here, and if I don’t come back—”“You have no wife,” said the cold voice, very quietly.“Nobody knows you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows… he always knows.…”“Is that right?” said Frank roughly.“Lord, is it? Well, I don’t think much of your manners, My Lord. Turn’ round and face me like a man, why don’t you?”“But I am not a man, Muggle,” said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames.“I am much, much more than a man. However… why not? I will face you.… Wormtail, come turn my chair around.” The servant gave a whimper.“You heard me, Wormtail.” Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair. The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug. And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it.",Frank

Dobby now handed Harry a small package, which turned out to be— socks.“Dobby is making them himself, sir!” the elf said happily.“He is buying the wool out of his wages, sir!” The left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the right sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.“They’re… they’re really… well, thanks, Dobby,” said Harry, and he pulled them on, causing Dobby’s eyes to leak with happiness again.“Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas dinner in the kitchens!” said Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving good- bye to Ron and the others as he passed.

Within the depths of the impenetrable white, Twilight saw two even whiter patches.“Come, young’uns. You’re right over the current. Can’t tell it on a night like this, though. So, welcome to the Island of Hoole.” Two giant Snowy Owls had melted out from the night and they were so white that by comparison the mist seemed gray.“I am Boron and this is my mate, Barran.”“You are the king and the queen of Hoole.” Twilight whispered. Digger and Gylfie, exhausted, plummeted down near them.“Yes, my dears. But we prefer to be called teachers, or rybs.

Now let us guide you the rest of the way. It’s not far.” The blizzard had been swallowed by the mist and the mist now seemed to melt away against the whiteness of Boron and Barran. The night turned black again and the stars broke out.

Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering.“There’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in,” Dean told Harry.“That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth.” Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in disgust.“We can’t have a Slytherin champion!”“And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,” said Seamus contemptuously.“But I wouldn’t have thought he’d have wanted to risk his good looks.”“Listen!” said Hermione suddenly.

Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure that Frank had invented him.

Martin was beside him.“You were spectacular, Soren. I was so nervous when I saw that crown fire break and then when we saw you getting sucked up, I nearly went yeep.”“But what happened?” Soren asked. They were to stay on the ridge until the rest of the chaw returned.“You mean to tell me you don’t know?”“Not exactly.”“You did a reverse loop to escape the pull and as you were coming out of it this coal flew by. Bubo said he never saw a coal of that size go up so high, but you caught it! Caught it on the loop, Soren. I mean it was better flying than anything Ruby has ever done. It was absolutely spectacular.”“Great Glaux, I wish I’d seen it,” Soren said. Martin hooted loudly.“You did it, Soren! You did it!” Otulissa flew in next with Ruby and Poot",Martin

The bell was due to ring at any moment, and Harry and Ron, who had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George’s fake wands at the back of the class, looked up, Ron holding a tin parrot and Harry, a rubber haddock.“Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age,” said Professor McGonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of Harry’s haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor— Ron’s parrot’s beak had severed it moments before—“I have something to say to you all.“The Yule Ball is approaching— a traditional part of the Tri- wizard Tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests. Now, the ball will be open only to fourth years and above— although you may invite a younger student if you wish—” Lavender Brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati Patil nudged her hard in the ribs, her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle. They both looked around at Harry. Professor McGonagall ignored them, which Harry thought was distinctly unfair, as she had just told off him and Ron.“Dress robes will be worn,” Professor McGonagall continued,“and the ball will start at eight o’clock on Christmas Day, finishing at midnight in the Great Hall.

At that very same moment, the harp could be heard as the guild began their evening practice. No one else noticed, of course, but for one fraction of a second the stone blade shimmered in a swirl of flickering light and sound. Eglantine began to shake uncontrollably.“The Place! The Place!” Eglantine screamed. Something started in a dim way to make sense to Soren. He put a talon on his sister’s shoulder and spun her around to face him.“Eglantine,” he said softly. His sister blinked.“Soren? Oh, Soren!” she cried as he swept her under his wings.“I ain’t done nothing, Mags, I swear.

He lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since. There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.“Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn’t.”“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar,“he had a hard war, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to—”“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked the cook.“There’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember! Nobody forced the door last night! No broken windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping.…” The villagers exchanged dark looks.“I always thought he had a nasty look about him, right enough,” grunted a man at the bar.“War turned him funny, if you ask me,” said the landlord.“Told you I wouldn’t like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn’t I, Dot?” said an excited woman in the corner.“Horrible temper,”",a woman at the bar

See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably. A bunchy Barred Owl poked her head in.“Any tea here?”“Oh, yes, I think a cup of milkberry tea would be lovely.”“I dropped the egg. I don’t deserve to live.” Primrose emitted a long sound halfway between a whistle and a wail.“Don’t say that!” Soren exclaimed.“Of course you deserve to live. Every owl deserves to live. That’s why we came here.” Matron stopped what she was doing and cocked her head and regarded the young Barn Owl. Perhaps he was learning; just perhaps he was beginning to catch a glimmer of the true meaning of a noble deed. She would leave him to comfort this little Pygmy Owl and send in an extra cup of tea and some milkberry tart. Soren stayed with Primrose for the rest of the evening.

Simply not enough food.”,23421,23448,True,710:another owl.F,"Moon blinking was perhaps the cruelest thing that St. Aggie’s did to young owls. By forcing them to sleep during the full shines of the moon, directly exposing their heads to the moon’s light, they destroyed the will, the very personalities of individual owls and made them perfectly obedient with no thoughts of their own. Soren and Gylfie had devised a plan for fooling the sleep monitors and escaping the full shine. It turned out so had Hortense. She, in fact, was an infiltrator and had been sneaking out the eggs that St. Aggie’s patrols had been snatching. Unfortunately, however, she was caught and killed. Still, they had heard that Hortense had become a legend in Ambala because of her heroic deeds.“Yes,” another owl was speaking now.“The egg production is down, and it is thought to be caused by a blight on the rodent population. Simply not enough food.” Soren and Gylfie exchanged looks. It was not just the rodent population. It was the St. Aggie’s egg snatchers. This was information they could offer. This might convince Boron and Barran that they really knew something.“We’ll look into it,” Boron said.“And now, I believe some of our new arrivals have requested to speak with us.” He turned and blinked at the four young owls. Speak with us! What was he talking about? Soren was not prepared to talk in front of all these owls.“Now who wants to go first?” Twilight, Digger, and Gylfie all looked at Soren.“Up here, young’un.” There was a perch in the middle of the half circle to which Boron nodded.

His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.“They need squeezing. You will collect the pus—”“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout,“and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus.

In front of them was a pair of tired and grumpy- looking wizards, one of whom was holding a large gold watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly: The man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thigh- length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.“Morning, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured football.“Hello there, Arthur,” said Basil wearily.“Not on duty, eh? It’s all right for some.… We’ve been here all night.… You’d better get out of the way, we’ve got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five- fifteen. Hang on, I’ll find your campsite.… Weasley… Weasley…” He consulted his parchment list.“About a quarter of a mile’s walk over there, first field you come to. Site manager’s called Mr. Roberts.

Boron kept muttering,“Don’t be too hard on them, dear. They’re just youngsters. Young males do that kind of thing.”“Boron, I would like to point out that Primrose and Gylfie are not males.”“Oh, but I still know a lot of wet poop jokes,” Primrose tooted up. The air was laced with the soft churr sounds that owls make when they laugh. They were all churring except for Barran. Boron was churring the hardest. His big white fluffy body was shaking so hard that he shook loose a few wisps of down.“Really! Boron! It’s not a laughing matter,” his mate said in dismay.“But it is, my dear. That’s the point.” And he began to laugh even harder. The owls had already settled down for the day. It had been several hours since Madame Plonk had sung her lovely“Night Is Done” song and all had wished one another good light until the next night. But Soren had trouble falling asleep, and then he woke up in that slow time of the day for owls, when silence seems to press down over everything and the air is thick with sunlight and the minutes drag by. Time seemed to crawl and one wondered if there would ever be blackness again. Once more, Soren felt that melancholy feeling. He was not sure exactly what was causing it. He should be so",his mate

Completely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to Gryffindor Tower, Cho’s voice echoing in his ears with every step he took.“Cedric— Cedric Diggory.” He had been starting to quite like Cedric— prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at Quidditch, and was handsome, and popular, and nearly everyone’s favorite champion. Now he suddenly realized that Cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who didn’t have enough brains to fill an eggcup.“Fairy lights,” he said dully to the Fat Lady— the password had been changed the previous day.“Yes, indeed, dear!” she trilled, straightening her new tinsel hair band as she swung forward to admit him. Entering the common room, Harry looked around, and to his surprise he saw Ron sitting ashen- faced in a distant corner. Ginny was sitting with him, talking to him in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice.“What’s up, Ron?” said Harry, joining them. Ron looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his face.“Why did I do it?” he said wildly.“I don’t know what made me do it!”“What?” said Harry.“He— er— just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him,” said Ginny.

She swayed slightly again and then said,“M— Master is stopped— hic— coming?”“Yeah,” said Harry,“we haven’t seen him since the first task.

Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron, and Hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast- Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn’t suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn’t seem to have mouths.“Ouch!” yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes.“It got me! Hagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.“Its end exploded!” said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid a burn on his hand.“Ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off,” said Hagrid, nodding.“Eurgh!” said Lavender Brown again.“Eurgh, Hagrid, what’s that pointy thing on it?”“Ah, some of’em have got stings,” said Hagrid enthusiastically(Lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box).“I reckon they’re the males.… The females’ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies.… I think they might be ter suck blood.”“Well, I can certainly see why we’re trying to keep them alive,” said Malfoy sarcastically.“Who wouldn’t want pets that can burn, sting, and bite all at once?”“Just because they’re not very pretty, it doesn’t mean they’re not useful,” Hermione snapped.“Dragon blood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t want a dragon",Lavender Brown

Owls that once prided themselves on silent flight beat their wings furiously, in their desperate efforts to get the injured owlets to safety.“SOREN!” The sound of his own name split the warm air. Soren looked up from his task of pecking out worms. It was Twilight who had called down to him and he was flanked by Primrose and Digger. The rest of the search- and- rescue chaw was following.“Soren, get up here fast as you can,” Twilight called again. Then Digger spiraled down.“This is important. Bring that worm and come on.”“No! No!” another owl said tersely.“All worms must be put into the pile first. Our chaw ryb said so.”“Drop the worm, Soren, and just come.” Soren couldn’t imagine what could be so important that they needed him so quickly. He followed Digger to a new hollow they had just fixed up to take care of the overflow from the infirmary. Outside the hollow, Gylfie and Primrose perched on a branch. They were very still. Soren got an awful feeling in his gizzard. He hesitated. He really did not want to go into that hollow. Digger gave him a bit of a nudge. Then Gylfie came up on the other side.

The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while.

Ron didn’t answer. He was glaring at Hermione and Krum, who were dancing nearby. Padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling in time to the music. Every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at Ron, who was completely ignoring her. Parvati sat down on Harry’s other side, crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from Beauxbatons.“You don’t mind, do you, Harry?” Parvati said.“What?” said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.“Oh never mind,” snapped Parvati, and she went off with the boy from Beauxbatons.

As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while.

Soren looked up from his task of pecking out worms. It was Twilight who had called down to him and he was flanked by Primrose and Digger. The rest of the search- and- rescue chaw was following.“Soren, get up here fast as you can,” Twilight called again. Then Digger spiraled down.“This is important. Bring that worm and come on.”“No! No!” another owl said tersely.“All worms must be put into the pile first. Our chaw ryb said so.”“Drop the worm, Soren, and just come.” Soren couldn’t imagine what could be so important that they needed him so quickly. He followed Digger to a new hollow they had just fixed up to take care of the overflow from the infirmary. Outside the hollow, Gylfie and Primrose perched on a branch. They were very still. Soren got an awful feeling in his gizzard. He hesitated. He really did not want to go into that hollow. Digger gave him a bit of a nudge. Then Gylfie came up on the other side. The shadows from the hollow seemed to draw him in against his will. He blinked. Twilight stood beside a heap of golden feathers splotched with blood.“So?” Soren said.

I’m starving.” The Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn’t been present at one since his own. He was quite looking forward to it. Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.“Hiya, Harry!” It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s starting! My brother Dennis!”“Er— good,” said Harry.“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat.“I just hope he’s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?”“Er— yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick.“Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor.“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione.“Parvati Patil’s twin’s in Ravenclaw, and they’re identical. You’d think they’d be together, wouldn’t you?” Harry looked up at",Colin
"it’s the password,”",93428,93440,True,2112:the Fat Lady.F,"to find himself facing the Fat Lady already. He had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady,“Violet’s just told me everything. Who’s just been chosen as school champion, then?”“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly.“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room. The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred; he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed.“How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!” roared George.“I didn’t,” Harry said.“I don’t know how—” But Angelina had now swooped down upon him;“Oh if it",the Fat Lady

Harry Potter?”“Er— yeah,” said Harry. Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable.“Ced’s talked about you, of course,” said Amos Diggory.“Told us all about playing against you last year.… I said to him, I said— Ced, that’ll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will.… You beat Harry Potter!” Harry couldn’t think of any reply to this, so he remained silent. Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered.“I told you… it was an accident.…”“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back.“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman… but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t",Amos Diggory

In normal circumstances, the parents are there if a fire breaks out, but tonight, for instance, we had to pick up that little Pygmy and a Northern Saw- whet. We got them back, but it taxed our chaw, believe me— carrying coals and injured owlets. Can’t exactly drop them in the coal bucket. And I don’t even like to think of the ones we might have missed and left behind.” The old Whiskered Screech raised his deformed foot.“Yes, Ezylryb?” Boron nodded to the owl.“Question for Bubo.” the Whiskered Screech’s voice was a low growl.“You think this fire was natural or more trouble with the rogue raids?”“No telling, sir. The rogues make good targets, and it wouldn’t be the first time raiding one caused a fire.”“Hmmm,” the Whiskered Screech replied, and then scratched his head with the second of the three remaining talons of one foot.“Next order of business,” Boron said.“Something about starvation in Ambala?” Ambala! Soren and Gylfie looked at each other. Ambala was where their friend the great Hortense came from. When they first had met Hortense at St. Aggie’s, they thought she was the most perfectly moon- blinked creature ever. Moon blinking was perhaps the cruelest thing that St. Aggie’s did to young owls. By forcing them to sleep during the full shines of the moon, directly exposing their heads to the moon’s light, they destroyed the will, the very personalities of individual owls and made them perfectly obedient with no thoughts of their own",the Whiskered Screech

What are your plans?”“We’re going to Hoolemere and the Great Ga’Hoole Tree,” Soren said.“Oh, how interesting,” the female replied in a voice that had a sneer embedded in it.“Oh, Mummy,” said the young owlet.“That’s the place I was telling you about.

Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.“Sorry,” Harry told the elf,“I just thought you were someone I knew.”“But I knows Dobby too, sir!” squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit.“My name is Winky, sir— and you, sir—” Her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon Harry’s scar.“You is surely Harry Potter!”“Yeah, I am,” said Harry.“But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!” she said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck.“How is he?” said Harry.“How’s freedom suiting him?”“Ah, sir,” said Winky, shaking her head,“ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free.”“Why?” said Harry, taken aback.“What’s wrong with him?”“Freedom is going to Dobby’s head, sir,” said Winky sadly.“Ideas above his station, sir.

He’s unbelievable. He’s really young too. Only just eighteen or something. He’s a genius, you wait until tonight, you’ll see.” There was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field. Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument. One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown. The other was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.“Just put them on, Archie, there’s a good chap. You can’t walk around like that, the Muggle at the gate’s already getting suspicious—”“I bought this in a Muggle shop,” said the old wizard stubbornly.“Muggles wear them.”“Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they wear these,” said the Ministry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped trousers.“I’m not putting them on,” said old Archie in indignation.“I like a healthy breeze’ round my privates, thanks.” Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away. Walking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made their way back through the campsite. Here and there, they saw more familiar faces: other Hogwarts",the other

Why else would you be out cavorting about the skies at such dangerous hours of the morning? I think your parents would be ashamed of you. I can tell you have good breeding.” She looked directly at Soren and blinked. Soren thought he might explode with anger. How did this owl know what his parents might think? How dare she suggest that she knew them so well that she knew they would be ashamed of him? And then there was a small soft, hissing voice.“I am ashamed of anyone who has eyes and still can not see.” It was Mrs. Plithiver. She slithered from the corner in the hollow.“But, of course, to see with two eyes is a very common thing.”“What is she talking about?” said the male.“What happened to the old days when servants served and were quiet?

What would he ever have to say to such a beautiful and elegant owl? Flying was one thing, but sitting and talking was another. Soren saw dozens of rosy- scaled blind snakes crawling up to the hollow where the harp was kept. Soon the Great Ga’Hoole Tree would begin to awake and stir to the lovely harmonies of Evensong.

If he was honest with himself, he really wanted to see Sirius again. He therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon— double Potions— feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson’s gang of Slytherin girls. All of them were looking at something Harry couldn’t see and sniggering heartily. Pansy’s pug- like face peered excitedly around Goyle’s broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached.“There they are, there they are!” she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands— Witch Weekly. The moving picture on the front showed a curly- haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.“You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!” Pansy said loudly, and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking startled. At that moment, the dungeon door opened, and Snape beckoned them all inside. Hermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual. Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of today’s potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk",Pansy Parkinson

The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for Bagman, their faces full of savage triumph. The boy began to scream.“No! Mother, no! I didn’t do it, I didn’t do it, I didn’t know! Don’t send me there, don’t let him!” The dementors were gliding back into the room. The boys’ three companions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy- lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called,“The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban; we will wait! He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!” But the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though Harry could see their cold, draining power starting to affect him.

And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we’ve got to do?” All the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why, when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration homework she had assigned.“You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!” she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles.“Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer—”“We don’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year!” said Dean Thomas indignantly.“Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can get!

Remember, I am the table and it itches something fierce.” It was not even dark yet, but the weather chaw owls were already on the takeoff limb. It was all they could do to hang on as the gale lashed about them and the limb bucked in the turbulent wind.

Perhaps he was learning; just perhaps he was beginning to catch a glimmer of the true meaning of a noble deed.

A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid- shaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent.“How many times, Kevin? You don’t— touch— Daddy’s— wand— yecchh!” She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy’s yells—“You bust slug! You bust slug!” A short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older than Kevin, who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls’ toes to skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron, and Hermione he muttered distractedly,“In broad daylight! Parents having a lie- in, I suppose—” Here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast. Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking",his mother

The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of the stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved to see that she wasn’t giggling.“You— er— look nice,” he said awkwardly.“Thanks,” she said.“Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall,” she added to Ron.“Right,” said Ron, looking around.“Where’s Hermione?” Parvati shrugged.“Shall we go down then, Harry?”“Okay,” said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room. Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole. The entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for eight o’clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open.

He was Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.“Hi,” said Cedric, looking around at them all. Everybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nodded. They had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, Gryffindor, in the first Quidditch match of the previous year.“Long walk, Arthur?” Cedric’s father asked.“Not too bad,” said Mr. Weasley.“We live just on the other side of the village there.

It’s just that it has been said that the Great Ga’Hoole Tree is invisible. That it grows on the island in the middle of a vast sea, a sea called Hoolemere that is nearly as wide as an ocean. A sea that is always wrapped in fog, an island feathered in blizzards, and a tree veiled in mist.”“So,” said Twilight,“it’s not really invisible, it’s just bad weather.”“Not exactly,” replied Swatums.

He remembered thinking this before when he was in the woods of The Beaks. He did notice, however, that Elvan’s fringe of light feathers below his beak seemed to be a permanently sooty gray. Soren thought of his own face, covered in pure white feathers. This was the most distinctive feature of Barn Owls, and he really did not want to think of it growing singed and sooty.

Soren could tell.“We done lost one of our best slipgizzles and a darned fine smith as well, one of the best of the rogues.” Bubo was speaking again. What is a slipgizzle? Digger mouthed the words.

He might have heard the word“rogue” but he wasn’t sure what that meant, either.“Without a reliable slipgizzle,” now Barran was speaking,“it’s going to make it very difficult to get any information about their activities in The Beaks.”“It was a very strategic spot where he set up his forge.” So that was it! thought Soren. That cave that, as Digger had said, not only held the spirit of the Barred Owl within its walls, sooty and scorched by countless fires, but also was his forge. He was a blacksmith, like Bubo. But he was also something else— a slipgizzle.

Joy filled him, a joy such as he had never felt since perhaps the first time he had ever flown. But how he got this coal was still a mystery to him. He flew back to the ridge where the buckets were. Martin was beside him.“You were spectacular, Soren. I was so nervous when I saw that crown fire break and then when we saw you getting sucked up, I nearly went yeep.”“But what happened?” Soren asked. They were to stay on the ridge until the rest of the chaw returned.“You mean to tell me you don’t know?”“Not exactly.”“You did a reverse loop to escape the pull and as you were coming out of it this coal flew by.

He became a bone… I buried it, while wearing the Invisibility Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid’s cabin.” There was complete silence now, except for Winky’s continued sobs. Then Dumbledore said,“And tonight…”“I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner,” whispered Barty Crouch.“Turned it into a Portkey. My master’s plan worked. He is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards.” The insane smile lit his features once more, and his head drooped onto his shoulder as Winky wailed and sobbed at his side. Chapter 36 The Parting of the Ways Dumbledore stood up. He stared down at Barty Crouch for a moment with disgust on his face. Then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it, ropes that twisted themselves around Barty Crouch, binding him tightly. He turned to Professor McGonagall.“Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs?”“Of course,” said Professor McGonagall. She looked slightly nauseous",Crouch

You can fly out of here now. The wall’s weeping.”“Huh?” Soren asked.“What do you mean the wall’s weeping?”“The ice is melting. Means warm air, the thermals have come. Easy flying.” The other owls were already up and standing at the rim of the hollow. The wall certainly was weeping. Glistening with wetness, it appeared shimmering, almost fiery as the setting sun turned its ice into liquid flames of pink, then orange and red.“Dumpy,” his father called.“Come over here, son. I want you to step up here and watch the young’uns fly. They are the masters of silent flight. Never going to hear a wing flap with these owls!” Just before they took off, Soren looked at each of the owls. He wasn’t the only one who had dreamed of the Mirror Lakes. They all wanted to go back. Could it be that wrong if they all wanted to do it? Twilight slid in close to him.“Soren, the three of us have been thinking.”“Yes?”“Thinking about The Beaks and the Mirror Lakes. We’ve been thinking, why not go back there for just a little while? You know, just to kind of rest up, get this fish out of our system.

Could this little owl be Eglantine?“They will think that you were a brave little Pygmy Owl,” Matron replied. Soren sighed.“What are you doing out there? Just don’t stand around, come in and make yourself useful,” Matron called. Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire.

I think I’ve got an unaspected planet! Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?”“It is Uranus, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, peering down at the chart.“Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?” said Ron. Most unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him, and it was this, perhaps, that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class.“A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you, with reference to your personal chart,” she snapped, sounding much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy- fairy self.“I want it ready to hand in next Monday, and no excuses!”“Miserable old bat,” said Ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner.“",Lavender Brown

I can’t imagine what it does to the air. I mean, flying through it must be almost impossible. You could never even half guess where the dead falls might be.”“Technically, the fire does that”—Otulissa had caught up with them—“because the fire climbs what is called, according to the literature, a fuel ladder.”“Yes, and think of me,” Martin now spoke.“I am on the ground, supposedly looking for the smallest embers. One of these crowning things happens, and at my weight I get sucked straight up the fuel ladder.”“We all have to spend time on the ground, not just you,” Soren said.“It could happen to any of us. You don’t have to be little.” Martin cocked his head and blinked. He did not look convinced. Although they had yet to be in an actual forest fire, each member of the chaw had a type of coal or ember they were in charge of gathering.

Very frustrating.”“Well, I never!”“The jokes were really funny, Otulissa,” Martin, the Northern Saw- whet, piped up.“Now, don’t go getting your feathers in a twist, darlin’.

Climbing the baggywrinkles and then straight into the gutter. Follow us!” The baggywrinkles were the shredded air currents that lay between the scuppers and the gutter. A power thrust was required to get over them. Soren banked and followed the veteran owl, Poot. Martin was in between the two. The tiny owl would get a boost from Poot’s speed, as a vacuum would be created, through which he could be sucked up and over the baggywrinkles right into the gutter. Ruby was just ahead of him.

It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady,“Violet’s just told me everything. Who’s just been chosen as school champion, then?”“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly.“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room. The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred; he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed.“How did you do it without getting a beard?

They knew about the violent updrafts, the so- called cool spots, and the dead falls. They even knew about the most dreaded trick fire could pull— fire blinking. This happened when the fire, raging with all its deadly beauty, actually transfixed an owl so that it could not fly. It went yeep and, with its wings locking, the owl lost its instincts to fly and suddenly plummeted to the ground. Or if the owl was already on the ground and the fire began to spread rapidly toward it, the owl simply could not lift off, for its wings hung still and motionless like dead things by its side. But no one had told him about the noise.“You’ll get used to it.” Elvan had flown up just over Soren and Martin.“It’s always a shock at first. There is no way to describe it.” He had to shout over the roar of the fire. Below, a sheet of flame lay flat against a hillside. The thermal drafts came up like slabs of rock. Martin and Soren were sucked up at least twenty feet but as they passed the hill they felt a terrific coolness and they dropped another thirty feet. Soren realized that it was only cool compared to the heat they had just flown through. Bubo now circled back. He had been flying far out in front.“Good ember beds ahead. Perfect for all of you.” So this was it, Soren thought. This was when they became true colliers. Just",Elvan

Hands still clamped over his buttocks, he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen. Harry hurried into the living room. Loud hangings and scrapings were coming from behind the Dursleys’ boarded- up fireplace, which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it.“What is it?” gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall and was staring, terrified, toward the fire.“What is it, Vernon?” But they were left in doubt barely a second longer.

Let’s just see what’s inside it!”“He’s supposed to work out the clue on his own,” Hermione said swiftly.“It’s in the tournament rules.…”“I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too,” Harry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather guiltily.“Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!” several people echoed. Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open. It was hollow and completely empty— but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room.

Sweetums was questioning her mate.“Well, what do you mean, Swatums, by‘ not exactly.’ Isn’t it either a legend or not? I mean, it’s not really real.”“Well, Sweetums, some say it’s simply invisible.”“What’s simple about being invisible?” Gylfie asked.“Ohh, hooo- hooo.” The two Sooty Owls were convulsed in laughter.“Doesn’t she remind you of Tibby, Swa- tums?” Then there was more cooing and giggling and disgusting preening. Soren felt that Gylfie’s question was a perfectly sensible one. What, indeed, was simple about in- visibleness?“Well, young’uns,” Swatums answered,“there is nothing simple. It’s just that it has been said that the Great Ga’Hoole Tree is invisible. That it grows on the island in the middle of a vast sea, a sea called Hoolemere that is nearly as wide as an ocean. A sea that is always wrapped in fog, an island feathered in blizzards, and a tree veiled in mist.”“So,” said Twilight,“it’s not really invisible, it’s just bad weather.”“Not exactly,” replied Swatums. Twilight cocked his head.“It seems that for some the fog lifts, the blizzards stop, and the mist blows away.”“For some?” asked Gylfie.“For those who believe.” Swatums paused and then sniffed in disdain.“But do they say what? Believe in what? No. You see, that is the problem. Owls with fancy ideas— ridiculous! That’s how you get into trouble. Sweetums and I don’t believe in fancy ideas.

First to stir were the families with small children; Harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before. A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid- shaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent.“How many times, Kevin? You don’t— touch— Daddy’s— wand— yecchh!” She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy’s yells—“You bust slug! You bust slug!” A short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older than Kevin, who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls’ toes to skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron, and Hermione he muttered distractedly,“In broad daylight! Parents having a lie- in, I suppose—” Here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast. Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces, as though sure this couldn’t work.

Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels.“Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!” Dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor.“Dobby will be missed— good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!”“See you later, Dobby!” Harry shouted, and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three at a time.

On the shoulders of giants, the little Elf will bring back the word!”“Twilight, puhleeze!” Soren said.“Why not? Makes perfect sense.”“Well, I might not be a giant like you, but I can hear better than any of you. I’m going, too. So count me in,” said Soren.“Me, too.” Digger was stretching his legs and seemed at least half awake.“Do you even know what we’re talking about?” Gylfie turned to the Burrowing Owl.“No, but we’re a band, remember? Nobody gets left out. Fill me in on the way to whatever we’re doing.” And so the band of four, as quietly as possible, moved out of their hollow with Gylfie in the lead. They left by the sky opening and flew a quarter way down the tree, where they entered a very small opening that Gylfie had discovered, which twisted and turned, pitched and curled through the huge trunk of the tree, until they had wound around to the back side of the Parliament hollow and found themselves actually slightly beneath that hollow, in the root structure of the tree. It was not that the walls were thin, Soren soon realized. It was rather that the roots of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree were transmitting the sounds. Gylfie hopped on Twilight’s shoulders and Soren pressed one ear to a root, as did Digger.“And so you say,",the Burrowing Owl

Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since. There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.“Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn’t.”“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar,“he had a hard war, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to—”“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked the cook.“There’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember!

Its head, however, was that of a woman. She turned her long, almond- shaped eyes upon Harry as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress. Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.“You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.”“So… so will you move, please?” said Harry, knowing what the answer was going to be.“No,” she said, continuing to pace.“Not unless you can answer my riddle. Answer on your first guess— I let you pass. Answer wrongly— I attack. Remain silent— I will let you walk away from me unscathed.” Harry’s stomach slipped several notches. It was Hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he could keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative route to the center.“Okay,” he said.“Can I hear the riddle?” The sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of the path, and recited:“First think of the person who lives in disguise, Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.

Neville looked around.“Oh hello,” he said, his voice much higher than usual.“Interesting lesson, wasn’t it? I wonder what’s for dinner, I’m— I’m starving, aren’t you?”“Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.“Oh yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice.“Very interesting dinner— I mean lesson— what’s for eating?” Ron gave Harry a startled look.“Neville, what—?” But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard.“It’s all right, sonny,” he said to Neville.“Why don’t you come up to my office?

They went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts, to find Neville there alone, sitting on his bed, reading. He looked a good deal calmer than at the end of Moody’s lesson, though still not entirely normal. His eyes were rather red.“You all right, Neville?” Harry asked him.“Oh yes,” said Neville,“I’m fine, thanks.

He was Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.“Hi,” said Cedric, looking around at them all. Everybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nodded. They had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, Gryffindor, in the first Quidditch match of the previous year.“Long walk, Arthur?” Cedric’s father asked.“Not too bad,” said Mr. Weasley.“We live just on the other side of the village there.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument. One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown. The other was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.“Just put them on, Archie, there’s a good chap.

Percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules, and Mr. Crouch had complied with the rule about Muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager; Harry doubted even Uncle Vernon would have spotted him for what he really was.“Pull up a bit of grass, Barty,” said Ludo brightly, patting the ground beside him.“No thank you, Ludo,” said Crouch, and there was a bite of impatience in his voice.“I’ve been looking for you everywhere.

Martin was supposed to not only collect cinders but report back on the larger coals that Soren and Otulissa were to retrieve. Soren hovered above with a careful eye on the little owl. He was getting used to the noise. Indeed, not only was he getting used to it but within the thunderous roar he could seek out smaller sounds, like the sound of Martin’s beating heart, which grew more rapid as he plunged. As Martin’s heartbeat quickened, Soren hoped with all his heart, gizzard, and soul that the little Saw- whet Owl would be all right. He could see now that Martin was on the ground.“Play your position, Otulissa,” Elvan rasped. Ruby had just caught another sparking coal.“But all the good ones go up there. We never get a chance.”“Shut your beak. You want to be sent back to the ridge? You’ll have your chance.” But Soren was not paying any attention to them. He must keep his focus on Martin, who was now just a little smudge on the ground. A cloud of smoke temporarily obscured him and Soren flew lower. There he was! There he was! Good heavens, he was coming up fast!“He’s coming in loaded!” Bubo slid in next to Elvan. And then he was there. Cinders poured from his small beak.

There’s an even better one my size higher up, but I would need a perch.”“At your service, Gylf!” Twilight was suddenly awake.“What a team we’ll make. On the shoulders of giants, the little Elf will bring back the word!”“Twilight, puhleeze!” Soren said.“Why not? Makes perfect sense.”“Well, I might not be a giant like you, but I can hear better than any of you. I’m going, too. So count me in,” said Soren.“Me, too.” Digger was stretching his legs and seemed at least half awake.“Do you even know what we’re talking about?” Gylfie turned to the Burrowing Owl.“No, but we’re a band, remember? Nobody gets left out. Fill me in on the way to whatever we’re doing.” And so the band of four, as quietly as possible, moved out of their hollow with Gylfie in the lead. They left by the sky opening and flew a quarter way down the tree, where they entered a very small opening that Gylfie had discovered, which twisted and turned, pitched and curled through the huge trunk of the tree, until they had wound around to the back side of the Parliament hollow and found themselves actually slightly beneath that hollow, in the root structure of the tree. It was not that the walls were thin, Soren soon realized. It was rather that the roots of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree were transmitting the sounds. Gylfie hopped on Twilight’s shoulders and Soren pressed one ear to a root, as did Digger.“And so you say,",the Burrowing Owl

They made their way slowly through the rows, staring eagerly around. It was only just dawning on Harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world; he had never really thought much about those in other countries. Their fellow campers were starting to wake up. First to stir were the families with small children; Harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before. A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid- shaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent.“How many times, Kevin? You don’t— touch— Daddy’s— wand— yecchh!” She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy’s yells—“You bust slug! You bust slug!” A short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older than Kevin, who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls’ toes to skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron, and Hermione he muttered distractedly,“In broad daylight! Parents having a lie- in, I suppose—” Here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast. Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking",his mother

Just don’t stand around, come in and make yourself useful,” Matron called. Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire.

There were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster’s Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail’s head on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire. Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn’t believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he’d gotten through the first task, and he wouldn’t have to face the second one for three months.“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands.“Open it, Harry, go on! Let’s just see what’s inside it!”“He’s supposed to work out the clue on his own,” Hermione said swiftly.“It’s in the tournament rules.…”“I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too,” Harry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather guiltily.“Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!” several people echoed.

I think your parents would be ashamed of you. I can tell you have good breeding.” She looked directly at Soren and blinked. Soren thought he might explode with anger. How did this owl know what his parents might think? How dare she suggest that she knew them so well that she knew they would be ashamed of him? And then there was a small soft, hissing voice.“I am ashamed of anyone who has eyes and still can not see.” It was Mrs. Plithiver. She slithered from the corner in the hollow.“But, of course, to see with two eyes is a very common thing.”“What is she talking about?” said the male.“What happened to the old days when servants served and were quiet? Imagine a nest- maid going on like this,” said the female.“Oh, yes,” said Mrs. Plithiver.“And I shall go on a bit more, if you permit me.” She proceeded to arrange herself in a lovely coil and swung her head toward Soren.“Of course, Mrs. Plithiver. Please go on,” Soren said.“I am a blind snake, but who says I can not see as much as you?” And then she swung her head sharply toward the female Masked Owl, who seemed startled, and it did appear indeed as if Mrs. Plithiver was looking directly at her with her two small eye dents.“Who says I can not see?

Highly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different- colored steam wafting all around him, no stroke of brilliance came to him, no sudden burst of understanding. Harry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and opened it. The wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating off the marble walls, but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever, if not more so with all the echoes. He snapped it shut again, worried that the sound would attract Filch, wondering whether that hadn’t been Cedric’s plan— and then, making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered away across the bathroom floor, someone spoke.“I’d try putting it in the water, if I were you.” Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He stood up, sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glum- looking girl sitting cross- legged on top of one of the taps. It was Moaning Myrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the S- bend of a toilet three floors below.“Myrtle!” Harry said in outrage,“I’m— I’m not wearing anything!” The foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had arrived.“I closed my eyes when you got in,” she said, blinking at him through her thick spectacles.“You haven’t been to see me",someone

Within five minutes, she had cleared her plate and departed. No sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by Fred Weasley.“Moody!” he said.“How cool is he?”“Beyond cool,” said George, sitting down opposite Fred.“Supercool,” said the twins’ best friend, Lee Jordan, sliding into the seat beside George.“We had him this afternoon,” he told Harry and Ron.“What was it like?” said Harry eagerly.

He found it hard to concentrate on Snape’s Potions test, and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient— a bezoar— meaning that he received bottom marks. He didn’t care, though; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the dungeon door.“I’ll meet you at dinner,” he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off upstairs. He’d just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all.… He hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her, and(rather sooner than he had expected) he found her, emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.“Er— Cho? Could I have a word with you?” Giggling should be made illegal, Harry thought furiously, as all the girls around Cho started doing it. She didn’t, though. She said,“Okay,” and followed him out of earshot of her classmates. Harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs.“Er,” he said.

Within the depths of the impenetrable white, Twilight saw two even whiter patches.“Come, young’uns. You’re right over the current. Can’t tell it on a night like this, though. So, welcome to the Island of Hoole.” Two giant Snowy Owls had melted out from the night and they were so white that by comparison the mist seemed gray.“I am Boron and this is my mate, Barran.”“You are the king and the queen of Hoole.” Twilight whispered. Digger and Gylfie, exhausted, plummeted down near them.“Yes, my dears. But we prefer to be called teachers, or rybs. The word ryb means teacher and deep knowledge,” said Barran.“We’re not keen on titles,” chuckled Boron.“But you came out to meet us?” said Soren.“Of course,” replied Boron.“You’ve done the hard part. Now let us guide you the rest of the way. It’s not far.” The blizzard had been swallowed by the mist and the mist now seemed to melt away against the whiteness of Boron and Barran. The night turned black again and the stars broke out.

But Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come in through the portrait hole. The time had come for drastic action.“Wait here,” he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati, and said,“Parvati? Will you go to the ball with me?” Parvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes.“Yes, all right then,” she said finally, blushing furiously.“Thanks,” said Harry, in relief.“Lavender— will you go with Ron?”“She’s going with Seamus,” said Parvati, and the pair of them giggled harder than ever.

You know how we feel about make- believe.” The little owlet dipped his head in embarrassment.“It’s not make- believe,” said Gylfie.“Oh, you can’t be serious, young’un,” said the male.“It’s just a story, an old legend.”“Let me tell you something,” said the female, who Soren disliked more and more by the second.“It does not do any good to believe in things you can not see, touch, or feel. It is a waste of time. From the look of your flight feathers’ development, not to mention your talons, it is apparent that you are either fly- aways or orphans. Why else would you be out cavorting about the skies at such dangerous hours of the morning? I think your parents would be ashamed of you. I can tell you have good breeding.” She looked directly at Soren and blinked. Soren thought he might explode with anger. How did this owl know what his parents might think? How dare she suggest that she knew them so well that she knew they would be ashamed of him? And then there was a small soft, hissing voice.“I am ashamed of anyone who has eyes and still can not see.” It was Mrs. Plithiver. She slithered from the corner in the hollow.“But, of course, to see with two eyes is a very common thing.”“What is she talking about?” said the male.“What happened to the old days when servants served and were quiet? Imagine a nest- maid going on like this,” said the female.“Oh,",the female

Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches!”“Where?” said many students eagerly, all looking in different directions.“There!” yelled a sixth year, pointing over the forest. Something large, much larger than a broomstick— or, indeed, a hundred broomsticks— was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle, growing larger all the time.“It’s a dragon!” shrieked one of the first years, losing her head completely.“Don’t be stupid… it’s a flying house!” said Dennis Creevey. Dennis’s guess was closer.… As the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it, they saw a gigantic, powder- blue, horse- drawn carriage, the size of a large house, soaring toward them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant. The front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower, coming in to land at a tremendous speed— then, with an almighty crash that made Neville jump backward onto a Slytherin fifth year’s foot, the horses’ hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage landed too, bouncing upon its",Dennis

The boys’ three companions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy- lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called,“The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban; we will wait! He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!” But the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though Harry could see their cold, draining power starting to affect him. The crowd was jeering, some of them on their feet, as the woman swept out of the dungeon, and the boy continued to struggle.“I’m your son!” he screamed up at Crouch.“I’m your son!”“You are no son of mine!” bellowed Mr. Crouch, his eyes bulging suddenly.“I have no son!” The wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in her seat. She had fainted. Crouch appeared not to have noticed.“Take them away!” Crouch roared at the dementors, spit flying from his mouth.“Take them away, and may they rot there!”“Father! Father, I wasn’t involved! No! No! Father, please!”“I think, Harry, it is time to return to my office,” said a quiet voice in Harry’s ear. Harry started. He looked around.

“it’s going to make it very difficult to get any information about their activities in The Beaks.”,41610,41630,True,172:Barran.F,", it seemed as if there was a little hole in the conversation, as if a word had dropped out, perhaps a word too awful to say. Soren wasn’t sure. But he felt a chill run through him.“Either way it’s a bad piece of work.” It was Ezylryb’s voice. Soren could tell.“We done lost one of our best slipgizzles and a darned fine smith as well, one of the best of the rogues.” Bubo was speaking again. What is a slipgizzle? Digger mouthed the words. Soren shrugged. He had never heard the word before. He might have heard the word“rogue” but he wasn’t sure what that meant, either.“Without a reliable slipgizzle,” now Barran was speaking,“it’s going to make it very difficult to get any information about their activities in The Beaks.”“It was a very strategic spot where he set up his forge.” So that was it! thought Soren. That cave that, as Digger had said, not only held the spirit of the Barred Owl within its walls, sooty and scorched by countless fires, but also was his forge. He was a blacksmith, like Bubo. But he was also something else— a slipgizzle. Gradually, the four owls began to understand that a slipgizzle was some sort of owl who listened hard and found out things.“That old Barred had ears like a Barn Owl,” Boron was saying.“We got more information from him than three other slipgizzles put together. And, as you said, my dear, his forge in The Beaks was ideally situated near the four",Barran

It was an outrage, as she told Soren forty times a night, that she had not been included in Strix Struma’s navigation chaw. Elvan continued speaking during their break.“And then, of course, after you have had enough nights of weather training we shall find a nice forest fire for you— nothing too big, mind you. Just a nice little beginning fire with a good mix of trees— Ga’Hooles, firs, pine, some soft and hard woods. Not too many ridges or mountains to complicate wind patterns.”“Pardon me,” piped up the little Northern Saw- whet Owl, Martin, who had been rescued the same night as Primrose.“Yes, Martin,” Elvan said.“Well, I don’t understand why we need new coals all the time. Once you start a fire going, wouldn’t there always be new coals?” This was some smart little owl, Soren thought. Why hadn’t the others thought of this question? Why were new coals from a new fire needed? Elvan turned to Bubo.“Bubo, as chief smith, would you care to answer that?”“Sure thing, mate.” Then he stepped up to Martin and, towering over him, began to speak.“A very good question. You are right, it is very possible to keep fires going forever and that is fine for some things— things like cooking and warming up a hollow. But for certain tasks, especially certain metalwork in the forge, we need new fresh coals that have been born of sparking trees full of sap. They become the blood of our hottest fires.

And then added.“Good light, Mrs. Plithiver.” But Mrs. Plithiver was already sound asleep. CHAPTER NINE A Parliament of Owls The four owls were in the antechamber of another hollow called the parliament. They were waiting to be admitted for their meeting with Boron and Barran.“Very important business inside, young’uns,” an owl on guard spoke in the soft tings of a Boreal Owl.“We won’t take long,” Gylfie said. I hope not, thought Soren. He was frightened. The other three had decided that he should be the one to speak. Another owl stuck her head out.“You can come in now. But be quiet and wait your turn.” She indicated a branch where they should perch. Soren looked about. It was not an especially large hollow, not nearly as big as the one in which they had first been welcomed by Boron and Barran. There were candles, of course, and there was one long white branch from a tree that Soren thought was called a birch that had been bent into a half circle. It was on this white branch that the owls of the parliament, no more than a dozen, perched. He recognized the elderly Strix Struma, the Spotted Owl he had met the night before. She perched next to a Great Horned Owl of an unusual ruddy color with even more unusual very black talons. Then there was an ancient and decrepit Whiskered Screech, who appeared to have the worst case of",another owl

If he was honest with himself, he really wanted to see Sirius again. He therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon— double Potions— feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson’s gang of Slytherin girls. All of them were looking at something Harry couldn’t see and sniggering heartily. Pansy’s pug- like face peered excitedly around Goyle’s broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached.“There they are, there they are!” she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands— Witch Weekly. The moving picture on the front showed a curly- haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.“You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!” Pansy said loudly, and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking startled. At that moment, the dungeon door opened, and Snape beckoned them all inside. Hermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual. Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of today’s potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk",Pansy Parkinson
"In normal circumstances,",22988,23101,True,188:the Whiskered Screech.M,"a perpetual squint, and his beak had a notch in it.“I’ve never seen a more disreputable- looking owl,” Gyl- fie whispered.“Great Glaux, look at his foot! His talons!” She paused.“Or lack of!” The Whiskered Screech, indeed, had only three talons on one foot. And just as Soren was blinking in a mixture of astonishment and horror, the old owl swung his head about and fixed Soren in his squinted gaze. Soren thought his gizzard was going to drop right out of him.“So, Elvanryb,” Boron turned and addressed another owl, a Great Gray.“It is your notion that we need to have a search- and- rescue attachment chaw on the colliering missions?”“Not all, Boron. I think they are only necessary when we are in areas near battle zones. So often the parents are off fighting. In normal circumstances, the parents are there if a fire breaks out, but tonight, for instance, we had to pick up that little Pygmy and a Northern Saw- whet. We got them back, but it taxed our chaw, believe me— carrying coals and injured owlets. Can’t exactly drop them in the coal bucket. And I don’t even like to think of the ones we might have missed and left behind.” The old Whiskered Screech raised his deformed foot.“Yes, Ezylryb?” Boron nodded to the owl.“Question for Bubo.” the Whiskered Screech’s voice was a low growl.“You think this fire was natural or more trouble with the rogue raids?”“No telling, sir. The rogues make good targets, and it wouldn’t be the first time raiding one caused a fire.”“Hmmm,” the Whiskered Screech replied, and then scratched his head with the second of the three remaining talons of one foot.“Next order of business,” Boron said.“Something about starvation in Ambala?” Ambala!

Ced?,23683,23750,True,239:Amos Diggory.?,"This is Amos Diggory, everyone,” said Mr. Weasley.“He works for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. And I think you know his son, Cedric?” Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He was Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.“Hi,” said Cedric, looking around at them all. Everybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nodded. They had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, Gryffindor, in the first Quidditch match of the previous year.“Long walk, Arthur?” Cedric’s father asked.“Not too bad,” said Mr. Weasley.“We live just on the other side of the village there. You?”“Had to get up at two, didn’t we, Ced? I tell you, I’ll be glad when he’s got his Apparition test. Still… not complaining… Quidditch World Cup, wouldn’t miss it for a sackful of Galleons— and the tickets cost about that. Mind you, looks like I got off easy.…” Amos Diggory peered good- naturedly around at the three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny.“All these yours, Arthur?”“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children.“This is Hermione, friend of Ron’s— and Harry, another friend—”“Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening.“Harry? Harry Potter?”“Er— yeah,” said Harry. Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable.“Ced’s talked about you, of course,” said Amos Diggory.“Told us",Amos Diggory

A tall black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Angelina came over to them, sat down, and said,“Well, I’ve done it! Just put my name in!”“You’re kidding!” said Ron, looking impressed.“Are you seventeen, then?” asked Harry.“’ Course she is, can’t see a beard, can you?” said Ron.“I had my birthday last week,” said Angelina.“Well, I’m glad someone from Gryffindor’s entering,” said Hermione.“I really hope you get it, Angelina!”“Thanks, Hermione,” said Angelina, smiling at her.“Yeah, better you than Pretty- Boy Diggory,” said Seamus, causing several Hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him.“What’re we going to do today, then?” Ron asked Harry and Hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall.“We haven’t been down to visit Hagrid yet,” said Harry.“Okay,” said Ron,“just as long as he doesn’t ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts.” A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on Hermione’s face.“I’ve just realized— I haven’t asked Hagrid to join S.P.E.W. yet!” she said brightly.“Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?”“What is it with her?” said Ron, exasperated,",Seamus
Wormtail.”,2371,2381,True,175:Frank.M,"across the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, grasping his walking stick firmly. Several feet from the entrance, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond. The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised him. Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man’s voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.“There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still hungry.”“Later,” said a second voice. This too belonged to a man— but it was strangely high- pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank’s neck stand up.“Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.” Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head. Then he went out of sight again.“Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice.“I— I don’t know, My Lord,” said the first voice nervously.“She set out to explore the house, I think.…”“You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,”",Frank

Brilliant!” roared George.“I didn’t,” Harry said.“I don’t know how—” But Angelina had now swooped down upon him;“Oh if it couldn’t be me, at least it’s a Gryffindor—”“You’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match, Harry!” shrieked Katie Bell, another of the Gryffindor Chasers.“We’ve got food, Harry, come and have some—”“I’m not hungry, I had enough at the feast—” But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn’t hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn’t put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn’t at all in the mood to celebrate.… Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak.

But he heard Mrs. P. muttering after the other snake was out of earshot.“To presume to have a gizzard and then go slithering off to Octavia, humming tunes and besieging her with milkberries. Well, I never!” Soren decided to skip visiting Mrs. P. He knew what he must do. He must“drop by” Madame Plonk’s, and he must tell her that here was a very special snake, a snake that had something even finer than a gizzard, a snake of the highest— what was that word Mrs. P. was always using?—“Sensibilities, artistic sensibilities.” CHAPTER NINETEEN A Visit to Madame Plonk You see, Madame Plonk, I know that perhaps this is not proper— me coming to you this way.” Soren could hardly keep his mind on what he was saying, as he had never in his life seen a hollow like this one. The air spun with colored light from the whirlyglasses that hung from the ceiling and sometimes jutted out from the walls, suspended on twigs jammed into cracks. There were several openings through which light poured. There were pieces of cloth embroidered with beautiful designs and one little niche spilled over with strands of luminous beads. Indeed, the hollow seemed to swirl with color. And in the middle of all this color there was a dazzling whiteness— Madame Plonk. Soren gulped and tried to keep his eyes from straying from that whiteness.“But I just know that Mrs. P. is rather shy and would never dare.”“Mrs. P.?” Madame Plonk broke in.“I don’t believe I know this snake.”“She came with me, ma’am. She’s my family’s old nest- maid snake.”“Oh, and you were saying that she wants to be in the harp guild?”“Yes, ma’am.” Soren thought he sounded so stupid. Who cares? he thought.

Ginny was sitting with him, talking to him in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice.“What’s up, Ron?” said Harry, joining them. Ron looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his face.“Why did I do it?” he said wildly.“I don’t know what made me do it!”“What?” said Harry.“He— er— just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him,” said Ginny.

Glistening with wetness, it appeared shimmering, almost fiery as the setting sun turned its ice into liquid flames of pink, then orange and red.“Dumpy,” his father called.“Come over here, son. I want you to step up here and watch the young’uns fly. They are the masters of silent flight. Never going to hear a wing flap with these owls!” Just before they took off, Soren looked at each of the owls. He wasn’t the only one who had dreamed of the Mirror Lakes. They all wanted to go back.

The faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered. He saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it, which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache. The wizened witch started whispering in his ear. Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour were grouped around the fire. They looked strangely impressive, silhouetted against the flames. Krum, hunched- up and brooding, was leaning against the mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other two. Cedric was standing with his hands behind his back, staring into the fire. Fleur Delacour looked around when Harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long, silvery hair.“What is it?” she said.“Do zey want us back in ze Hall?” She thought he had come to deliver a message. Harry didn’t know how to explain what had just happened. He just stood there, looking at the three champions. It struck him how very tall all of them were. There was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman entered the room. He took Harry by the arm and led him forward.“Extraordinary!” he muttered, squeezing Harry’s arm.“Absolutely extraordinary! Gentlemen… lady,” he added, approaching the fireside and addressing the other three.“May I introduce— incredible though it may seem— the fourth Triwizard champion?” Viktor Krum straightened up.

His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.“They need squeezing. You will collect the pus—”“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout,“and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.”“Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice.“She tried to curse hers off.”“Silly girl,” said Professor Sprout, shaking her head.“",Professor Sprout

Soren stole a glance at her. There was pure venom in her eyes. Why couldn’t she just be angry about being in this chaw? What did Bubo have to do with it? Soren thought. He knew why, of course. Otulissa thought she was too good to have anything to do with Bubo. Neither Bubo nor any of the owls in this chaw had the distinguished background of Otulissa. It was an outrage, as she told Soren forty times a night, that she had not been included in Strix Struma’s navigation chaw. Elvan continued speaking during their break.“And then, of course, after you have had enough nights of weather training we shall find a nice forest fire for you— nothing too big, mind you. Just a nice little beginning fire with a good mix of trees— Ga’Hooles, firs, pine, some soft and hard woods. Not too many ridges or mountains to complicate wind patterns.”“Pardon me,” piped up the little Northern Saw- whet Owl, Martin, who had been rescued the same night as Primrose.“Yes, Martin,” Elvan said.“Well, I don’t understand why we need new coals all the time. Once you start a fire going, wouldn’t there always be new coals?” This was some smart little owl, Soren thought. Why hadn’t the others thought of this question? Why were new coals from a new fire needed? Elvan turned to Bubo.“Bubo, as chief smith, would you care to answer that?”“Sure thing, mate.” Then he stepped up to Martin and, towering over him, began to speak.“A very good question.

There were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his collar, apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely. As they drew nearer, an odd rattling noise reached their ears, punctuated by what sounded like minor explosions.“Mornin’!” Hagrid said, grinning at Harry, Ron, and Hermione.“Be’er wait fer the Slytherins, they won’ want ter miss this— Blast- Ended Skrewts!”“Come again?” said Ron. Hagrid pointed down into the crates.“Eurgh!” squealed Lavender Brown, jumping backward.“Eurgh” just about summed up the Blast- Ended Skrewts in Harry’s opinion. They looked like deformed, shell- less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy- looking, with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads. There were about a hundred of them in each crate, each about six inches long, crawling over one another, bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes. They were giving off a very powerful smell of rotting fish. Every now and then, sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt, and with a small phut, it would be propelled forward several inches.“On’y jus’ hatched,” said Hagrid proudly,“so yeh’ll be able ter raise’em yerselves!

Voldemort ignored them.“It is a disappointment to me… I confess myself disappointed.…” One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort’s feet.“Master!” he shrieked,“Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!” Voldemort began to laugh.

He lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since. There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.“Unfriendly, like.

What would he ever have to say to such a beautiful and elegant owl? Flying was one thing, but sitting and talking was another. Soren saw dozens of rosy- scaled blind snakes crawling up to the hollow where the harp was kept. Soon the Great Ga’Hoole Tree would begin to awake and stir to the lovely harmonies of Evensong.

When we went for our tour of the guilds, I knew immediately that the harp was for me.

And the very best part was to try to— oh, how shall I explain— weave the music into Madame Plonk’s voice. So that together the sound of the harp and the sound of Madame Plonk’s voice made something so large and splendid.” Soren blinked. Mrs. P., he thought, had something much better than a gizzard.“Must be off myself,” the other nest snake said cheerily.“I’m just going around to drop in on Octavia, bring her a few well- seasoned milkberries. She does love them so and, as you know, she does keep the nest for Madame Plonk. Never can hurt, can it? Ta- ta!” And she slithered out of the hollow. Soren wedged himself into a corner where he wouldn’t be seen. But he heard Mrs. P. muttering after the other snake was out of earshot.“To presume to have a gizzard and then go slithering off to Octavia, humming tunes and besieging her with milkberries.

I can tell you have good breeding.” She looked directly at Soren and blinked. Soren thought he might explode with anger. How did this owl know what his parents might think? How dare she suggest that she knew them so well that she knew they would be ashamed of him? And then there was a small soft, hissing voice.“I am ashamed of anyone who has eyes and still can not see.” It was Mrs. Plithiver.

You are right, it is very possible to keep fires going forever and that is fine for some things— things like cooking and warming up a hollow. But for certain tasks, especially certain metalwork in the forge, we need new fresh coals that have been born of sparking trees full of sap. They become the blood of our hottest fires.

I can’t imagine what it does to the air. I mean, flying through it must be almost impossible. You could never even half guess where the dead falls might be.”“Technically, the fire does that”—Otulissa had caught up with them—“because the fire climbs what is called, according to the literature, a fuel ladder.”“Yes, and think of me,” Martin now spoke.“I am on the ground, supposedly looking for the smallest embers. One of these crowning things happens, and at my weight I get sucked straight up the fuel ladder.”“We all have to spend time on the ground, not just you,” Soren said.“It could happen to any of us. You don’t have to be little.” Martin cocked his head and blinked. He did not look convinced.

Dobby heard Professor McGonagall and Professor Moody in the staffroom, talking about the next task.… Dobby can not let Harry Potter lose his Wheezy!” Harry’s doubts vanished. Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels.“Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!” Dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor.“Dobby will be missed— good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!”“See you later, Dobby!” Harry shouted, and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three at a time.

And I think you know his son, Cedric?” Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He was Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.“Hi,” said Cedric, looking around at them all. Everybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nodded. They had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, Gryffindor, in the first Quidditch match of the previous year.“Long walk, Arthur?” Cedric’s father asked.“Not too bad,” said Mr. Weasley.“We live just on the other side of the village there. You?”“Had to get up at two, didn’t we, Ced? I tell you, I’ll be glad when he’s got his Apparition test. Still… not complaining… Quidditch World Cup, wouldn’t miss it for a sackful of Galleons— and the tickets cost about that.

Harry Potter?”“Er— yeah,” said Harry.

And look at those sparks from the tail just below the moon. Great Glaux, even the moon is beginning to look red.” Digger’s voice was quavery with worry.“I told you about Octavia. How she thinks it’s an omen, or at least I think she thinks it is, even though she won’t really admit it.”“Why won’t she admit it?” Digger asked.“I think she’s sensitive about coming from the great North Waters. She says everyone there is very superstitious, but I don’t know, I guess she just thinks the owls here will laugh at her or something. I’m not sure.” Suddenly, Soren was experiencing a tight, uncomfortable feeling as he flew. He had never felt uncomfortable flying, even when he was diving into the fringes of forest fires to gather coals on colliering missions. But, indeed, he could almost feel the sparks from that comet’s tail. It was as if they were hot sizzling points pinging off his wings, singeing his flight feathers as the infernos of burning forests never had.

From the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three Dursleys scrambling, panic- stricken, across the room. Next moment Dudley came flying into the hall, looking terrified.“What happened?” said Harry.“What’s the matter?” But Dudley didn’t seem able to speak. Hands still clamped over his buttocks, he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen. Harry hurried into the living room. Loud hangings and scrapings were coming from behind the Dursleys’ boarded- up fireplace, which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it.“What is it?” gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall and was staring, terrified, toward the fire.“What is it, Vernon?” But they were left in doubt barely a second longer. Voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace.“Ouch! Fred, no— go back, go back, there’s been some kind of mistake— tell George not to— OUCH! George, no, there’s no room, go back quickly and tell Ron—”“Maybe Harry can hear us, Dad— maybe he’ll be able to let us out—” There was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire.“Harry?

He certainly didn’t want the owls of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree to think he came from such a murderous family. Kludd was the only one, after all.“I was snatched by a St. Aggie’s patrol. It was at St. Aggie’s that I met Gylfie.” It was difficult at first to speak and not look at Ezylryb’s mangled foot, but as he spoke, Soren became more relaxed. The owls seemed attentive but not particularly impressed, not even when he told them about Hortense and that it was not simply starvation that was accounting for the low egg counts in Ambala.“And so?” Barran said when Soren appeared to have concluded.“And so what?” Soren asked.“What is it you want, dear?”“The four of us are a band. We have flown together, fought together, and escaped many dangers— as a band. We know from our experience that there is great evil that threatens every owl in every owl kingdom on earth. We want only to fight this evil, to become guardian knights of this order.” He saw Ezylryb stifle a yawn and pick up what appeared to be a dried caterpillar to munch.“We feel that we have special knowledge.

A perfect example.”,31158,31169,True,1537:young ones.?,".” Soren wondered if he would ever have the nerve to just”drop by” Madame Plonk’s for a cup oftea. What would he ever have to say to such a beautiful and elegant owl? Flying was one thing, but sitting and talking was another. Soren saw dozens of rosy- scaled blind snakes crawling up to the hollow where the harp was kept. Soon the Great Ga’Hoole Tree would begin to awake and stir to the lovely harmonies of Evensong. For twilight was upon them. CHAPTER THIRTEEN Books of the Yonder Now, young ones, please follow me as we explore the wondrous root structure of our dear tree.

Pellets properly buried nourish the tree,” the ryb continued.“Oh, I’ll find you one,” Otulissa quickly volunteered and bustled off.“This is the most borrring class,” sighed Soren. They had been stomping around the base of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree all during twilight.“I don’t think it’s that bad,” said Digger.

"great Glaux,",60760,60770,True,172:Barran.F,", dear. He’ll show up.” Soren looked at Boron and Barran. Despite their words, they did seem worried. And Soren himself had a funny feeling in his gizzard. Gylfie suddenly turned to him.“I think they’re worried about Ezylryb.” Soren blinked.“Maybe tomorrow we should go out and take a look.” Twilight and Digger alighted at that moment next to them on the branch.“Take a look?” Digger asked.“A look for what?”“Ezylryb,” Twilight said.“I heard them talking, too.” There was a sudden pulsing of light in the sky and then a gasp from all the owls as a radiance swept the black night.“What is it? What is it?”“Oh, great Glaux, we are blessed!” hooted Barran.“It is the Aurora Glaucora,” Boron sang out. Soren, Gylfie, Digger, Twilight, and Eglantine all looked at one another. They had no idea what Barran and Boron were talking about. But the sky seemed rinsed with colors, colors that streamed like banners through the night. Suddenly, Madame Plonk abandoned her perch by the harp and flew out into the brilliance of the night. Still singing, she swept through the long lances of light, her white body reflecting the colors. It was irresistible. Soren remembered that morning months ago when he and Madame Plonk had flown through the rainbow. But the rainbow was pale next to these pulsing banners of light that draped the sky. His worries about Ezylryb grew dimmer as the colors grew brighter. The",Barran

The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of the stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved to see that she wasn’t giggling.“You— er— look nice,” he said awkwardly.“Thanks,” she said.“Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall,” she added to Ron.“Right,” said Ron, looking around.“Where’s Hermione?” Parvati shrugged.“Shall we go down then, Harry?”“Okay,” said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room. Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole. The entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for eight o’clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open. Those people who were meeting partners from different Houses were edging through the crowd trying to find one another. Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led her over to Harry and Ron.“Hi,” said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of bright turquoise. She didn’t look too enthusiastic about having Ron as a partner, though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as",Parvati
"“Don’t worry,",50169,50184,True,209:Martin.?,"And although Soren, like other owls, did not have the keenest sense of smell, the air seemed tinged with an acrid odor. They landed on the ridge of some high cliffs. Ezylryb was already pointing with his three- taloned foot to some clouds just beyond the ridge.“We call them Ga’Hoole clouds. You know why?” Otulissa’s talon shot up.“Because they are the shape of the seeds found in the Ga’Hoole fruits.”“Right- o, missy,” Ezylryb said. Martin gave a little sigh.“She never stops, does she?” It was clear that Martin was very nervous. More nervous than the others. Soren felt bad for him. He was the smallest owl in the chaw. It had to be scary.“Don’t worry, Martin. You’re going to be all right.”“Soren, that’s kind of you, but do you realize that I am the first Saw- whet to ever be in the colliering chaw?”“They must think you’re special, Martin,” Soren said.“But what if I’m not?” Martin said, a squeak of desperation creeping into his voice. Ezylryb continued speaking about the Ga’Hoole clouds.“The reason their tops are curved like that is because— well, you tell me.” Once again, Otulissa’s talon shot up.“It’s simple weather physics.

The thought gave him no pleasure at all.“’ Arry!” He looked around. Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Beyond her, far across the grounds, Harry could see Hagrid helping Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness. The Beauxbatons carriage was about to take off.“We will see each uzzer again, I’ ope,” said Fleur as she reached him, holding out her hand.“I am’ oping to get a job’ ere, to improve my Eenglish.”“It’s very good already,” said Ron in a strangled sort of voice.

He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there.“And here we have six missing Death Eaters… three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return… he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever… he will be killed, of course… and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.” The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks.“He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight.…“Yes,” said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry’s direction.“Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.” There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy’s voice spoke from under the mask.“Master, we crave to know… we beg you to tell us… how you have achieved this… this miracle… how you managed to return to us.…”“Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,” said Voldemort.“And it begins— and ends— with my young friend here.” He walked lazily over to stand",the Death Eaters
“All worms must be put into the pile first.,57097,57114,True,710:another owl.F,", Soren heard the arrival of a new batch of owlets being brought in. There was no quiet flying this day. Owls that once prided themselves on silent flight beat their wings furiously, in their desperate efforts to get the injured owlets to safety.“SOREN!” The sound of his own name split the warm air. Soren looked up from his task of pecking out worms. It was Twilight who had called down to him and he was flanked by Primrose and Digger. The rest of the search- and- rescue chaw was following.“Soren, get up here fast as you can,” Twilight called again. Then Digger spiraled down.“This is important. Bring that worm and come on.”“No! No!” another owl said tersely.“All worms must be put into the pile first. Our chaw ryb said so.”“Drop the worm, Soren, and just come.” Soren couldn’t imagine what could be so important that they needed him so quickly. He followed Digger to a new hollow they had just fixed up to take care of the overflow from the infirmary. Outside the hollow, Gylfie and Primrose perched on a branch. They were very still. Soren got an awful feeling in his gizzard. He hesitated. He really did not want to go into that hollow. Digger gave him a bit of a nudge. Then Gylfie came up on the other side. The shadows from the hollow seemed to draw him in against his will. He blinked. Twilight stood beside a heap of golden feathers splotched with blood.“So?” Soren said.

The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably. A bunchy Barred Owl poked her head in.“Any tea here?”“Oh, yes, I think a cup of milkberry tea would be lovely.”“I dropped the egg.

Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered.“I told you… it was an accident.…”“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back.“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman… but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh?

I mean— they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety.…”“Eat dung, Malfoy!” said Ron, the same color as the dress robes as he snatched them back out of Malfoy’s grip. Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.“So… going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name? There’s money involved as well, you know… you’d be able to afford some decent robes if you won.…”“What are you talking about?” snapped Ron.“Are you going to enter?” Malfoy repeated.“I suppose you will, Potter? You never miss a chance to show off, do you?”“Either explain what you’re on about or go away, Malfoy,” said Hermione testily, over the top of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4. A gleeful smile spread across Malfoy’s pale face.“Don’t tell me you don’t know?” he said delightedly.“You’ve got a father and brother at the Ministry and you don’t even know?

Ludo Bagman, a Death Eater?“Only,” said Bagman, smiling awkwardly,“well— I know I’ve been a bit of an idiot—” One or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently. Mr. Crouch did not appear to share their feelings. He was staring down at Ludo Bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislike.“You never spoke a truer word, boy,” someone muttered dryly to Dumbledore behind Harry. He looked around and saw Moody sitting there again.“If I didn’t know he’d always been dim, I’d have said some of those Bludgers had permanently affected his brain.…”“Ludovic Bagman, you were caught passing information to Lord Voldemort’s supporters,” said Mr. Crouch.“For this, I suggest a term of imprisonment in Azkaban lasting no less than—” But there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches.

His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.“They need squeezing. You will collect the pus—”“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout,“and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.”“Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice.“She tried to curse hers off.”“Silly girl,” said Professor Sprout, shaking her head.“",Professor Sprout

Joy filled him, a joy such as he had never felt since perhaps the first time he had ever flown. But how he got this coal was still a mystery to him. He flew back to the ridge where the buckets were. Martin was beside him.“You were spectacular, Soren. I was so nervous when I saw that crown fire break and then when we saw you getting sucked up, I nearly went yeep.”“But what happened?” Soren asked. They were to stay on the ridge until the rest of the chaw returned.“You mean to tell me you don’t know?”“Not exactly.”“You did a reverse loop to escape the pull and as you were coming out of it this coal flew by.

She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and Harry’s names. Harry had never been through here before. He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape’s dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with torches",the Fat Lady

Harry was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly- Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.“I hope she stays, that woman!” said Parvati Patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch.“That’s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like… proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters.…”“What about Hagrid?” Harry said angrily as they went up the steps.“What about him?” said Parvati in a hard voice.“He can still be gamekeeper, can’t he?” Parvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good time all the same. She was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the next weekend trip.“That was a really good lesson,” said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall.“I didn’t know half the things Professor Grubbly- Plank told us about uni—”“Look at this!” Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily Prophet article under Hermione’s nose.

Ron didn’t answer. He was glaring at Hermione and Krum, who were dancing nearby. Padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling in time to the music. Every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at Ron, who was completely ignoring her. Parvati sat down on Harry’s other side, crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from Beauxbatons.“You don’t mind, do you, Harry?” Parvati said.“What?” said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.“Oh never mind,” snapped Parvati, and she went off with the boy from Beauxbatons. When the song ended, she did not return. Hermione came over and sat down in Parvati’s empty chair. She was a bit pink in the face from dancing.“Hi,” said Harry. Ron didn’t say anything.“It’s hot, isn’t it?” said Hermione, fanning herself with her hand.“Viktor’s just gone to get some drinks.” Ron gave her a withering look.“Viktor?” he said.“Hasn’t he asked you to call him Vicky yet?” Hermione looked at him in surprise.“What’s",Parvati

Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn’t even got his letter? His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.“They need squeezing. You will collect the pus—”“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout,“and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus.

Harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before Professor McGonagall closed the door.“Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once, striding over to her headmistress.“Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!” Somewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little boy? Madame Maxime had drawn herself up to her full, and considerable, height. The top of her handsome head brushed the candle- filled chandelier, and her gigantic black- satin bosom swelled.“What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly- dorr?” she said imperiously.“I’d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,” said Professor Karkaroff. He was wearing a steely smile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice.“Two Hogwarts champions?

Harry sighed.“Can’t you think of anyone who’d go with Ron?” he said, lowering his voice so that Ron wouldn’t hear.“What about Hermione Granger?” said Parvati.“She’s going with someone else.” Parvati looked astonished.“Ooooh— who?” she said keenly. Harry shrugged.“No idea,” he said.“So what about Ron?”“Well…” said Parvati slowly,“I suppose my sister might… Padma, you know… in Ravenclaw. I’ll ask her if you like.”“Yeah, that would be great,” said Harry.“Let me know, will you?” And he went back over to Ron, feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth, and hoping very much that Padma Patil’s nose was dead center. Chapter 23 The Yule Ball Despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given for the holidays, Harry was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent the week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone else.

I find it makes for rather temperamental wands… however, to each his own, and if this suits you…” Mr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for scratches or bumps; then he muttered,“Orchideous!” and a bunch of flowers burst from the wand tip.“Very well, very well, it’s in fine working order,” said Mr. Ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing them to Fleur with her wand.“Mr. Diggory, you next.” Fleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he passed her.“Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn’t it?” said Mr. Ollivander, with much more enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand.“Yes, I remember it well.

The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them.“Wangoballwime?”“Sorry?” said Cho.“D’you— d’you want to go to the ball with me?” said Harry. Why did he have to go red now?

He’s unbelievable. He’s really young too. Only just eighteen or something. He’s a genius, you wait until tonight, you’ll see.” There was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field. Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument. One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown. The other was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.“Just put them on, Archie, there’s a good chap. You can’t walk around like that, the Muggle at the gate’s already getting suspicious—”“I bought this in a Muggle shop,” said the old wizard stubbornly.“Muggles wear them.”“Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they wear these,” said the Ministry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped trousers.“I’m not putting them on,” said old Archie in indignation.“I like a healthy breeze’ round my privates, thanks.” Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away.

The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady.

The coal he held in his beak cast an eerie glow on his whiskered face. His amber eyes appeared red.“I hear you did a fair night’s work,” he mumbled through the coal.

An uncertain feeling that was not quite a doubt, yet not a real belief, began to stir in Soren’s gizzard.“This is the place?” his voice quavered.“Of course it’s the place,” the Spotted Owl replied.“Then get us some battle claws— we’re ready!” Twilight stomped one talon impatiently.“You’re ready!” Otulissa gasped.“You think just because you escaped and killed two rattlebrained owls, you’re ready?”“And the bobcat,” Soren said.“And the crows,” Digger piped up.“Well",The Spotted Owl

Finally he straightened up, turned to his fellow judges, and said,“A conference before we give the marks, I think.” The judges went into a huddle. Madam Pomfrey had gone to rescue Ron from Percy’s clutches; she led him over to Harry and the others, gave him a blanket and some Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and her sister. Fleur had many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn, but she didn’t seem to care, nor would she allow Madam Pomfrey to clean them.“Look after Gabrielle,” she told her, and then she turned to Harry.“You saved’ er,” she said breathlessly.“Even though she was not your’ ostage.”“Yeah,” said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he’d left all three girls tied to the statue. Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek(he felt his face burn and wouldn’t have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again), then said to Ron,“And you too— you’ elped—”“Yeah,” said Ron, looking extremely hopeful,“yeah, a bit—” Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him. Hermione looked simply furious, but just then, Ludo Bagman’s magically magnified voice boomed out beside them, making them all jump, and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet",Madam Pomfrey
“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs.,21210,21240,True,175:Matron.?,"you were a brave little Pygmy Owl,” Matron replied. Soren sighed.“What are you doing out there? Just don’t stand around, come in and make yourself useful,” Matron called. Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably. A bunchy Barred Owl poked her head in.“Any tea here?”“Oh, yes, I think a cup of milkberry tea would be lovely.”“I dropped the egg. I don’t deserve to live.” Primrose emitted a long sound halfway between a whistle and a wail.“Don’t say that!” Soren exclaimed.“Of course you deserve to live. Every owl deserves to live.",Matron
"“Creevey,",59096,59101,True,374:Baddock.M,"RAVENCLAW!” shouted the hat. Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw table, where everyone was applauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down. For a fleeting second, Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.“Baddock, Malcolm!”“SLYTHERIN!” The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins. Harry wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other. Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down.“Branstone, Eleanor!”“HUFFLEPUFF!”“Cauldwell, Owen!”“HUFFLEPUFF!”“Creevey, Dennis!” Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid’s moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers’ table. About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming— a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature. He winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim opened wide—“GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted. Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey, beaming widely, took off the hat, placed it back on the stool,",Baddock
"“Play your position,",51912,51919,True,205:Elvan.?,"Soren.” Soren would fly cover until Martin returned with a beakful of cinders. Elvan actually carried the very small cinder pot in his talons. Martin was supposed to not only collect cinders but report back on the larger coals that Soren and Otulissa were to retrieve. Soren hovered above with a careful eye on the little owl. He was getting used to the noise. Indeed, not only was he getting used to it but within the thunderous roar he could seek out smaller sounds, like the sound of Martin’s beating heart, which grew more rapid as he plunged. As Martin’s heartbeat quickened, Soren hoped with all his heart, gizzard, and soul that the little Saw- whet Owl would be all right. He could see now that Martin was on the ground.“Play your position, Otulissa,” Elvan rasped. Ruby had just caught another sparking coal.“But all the good ones go up there. We never get a chance.”“Shut your beak. You want to be sent back to the ridge? You’ll have your chance.” But Soren was not paying any attention to them. He must keep his focus on Martin, who was now just a little smudge on the ground. A cloud of smoke temporarily obscured him and Soren flew lower. There he was! There he was! Good heavens, he was coming up fast!“He’s coming in loaded!” Bubo slid in next to Elvan. And then he was there. Cinders poured from his small beak.

Why couldn’t they go back there? Where were they supposed to be going instead? Soren kept forgetting. All he could remember were the rolls of warm wind to play on, the still, glasslike lake, the everlasting summer. No ice, no blizzard. Why not live there happily ever after? The dream tugged on him. In his sleep, he felt his gizzard turn and something begin to dim, while the longing for The Beaks and the Mirror Lakes grew stronger and stronger.“Time to get up, young’uns.” It was the male puffin, nudging Soren with one of his large, orange, webbed feet.“Wind died down. You can fly out of here now. The wall’s weeping.”“Huh?” Soren asked.“What do you mean the wall’s weeping?”“The ice is melting. Means warm air, the thermals have come. Easy flying.” The other owls were already up and standing at the rim of the hollow. The wall certainly was weeping. Glistening with wetness, it appeared shimmering, almost fiery as the setting sun turned its ice into liquid flames of pink, then orange and red.“Dumpy,” his father called.“Come over here, son. I want you to step up here and watch the young’uns fly. They are the masters of silent flight. Never going to hear a wing flap with these owls!” Just before they took off, Soren looked at each of the owls. He was",the male puffin

But he heard Mrs. P. muttering after the other snake was out of earshot.“To presume to have a gizzard and then go slithering off to Octavia, humming tunes and besieging her with milkberries. Well, I never!” Soren decided to skip visiting Mrs. P. He knew what he must do. He must“drop by” Madame Plonk’s, and he must tell her that here was a very special snake, a snake that had something even finer than a gizzard, a snake of the highest— what was that word Mrs. P. was always using?—“Sensibilities, artistic sensibilities.” CHAPTER NINETEEN A Visit to Madame Plonk You see, Madame Plonk, I know that perhaps this is not proper— me coming to you this way.” Soren could hardly keep his mind on what he was saying, as he had never in his life seen a hollow like this one. The air spun with colored light from the whirlyglasses that hung from the ceiling and sometimes jutted out from the walls, suspended on twigs jammed into cracks. There were several openings through which light poured. There were pieces of cloth embroidered with beautiful designs and one little niche spilled over with strands of luminous beads. Indeed, the hollow seemed to swirl with color. And in the middle of all this color there was a dazzling whiteness— Madame Plonk. Soren gulped and tried to keep his eyes from straying from that whiteness.“But I just know that Mrs. P. is rather shy and would never dare.”“Mrs. P.?” Madame Plonk broke in.“I don’t believe I know this snake.”“She came with me, ma’am. She’s my family’s old nest- maid snake.”“Oh, and you were saying that she wants to be in the harp guild?”“Yes, ma’am.” Soren thought he sounded so stupid. Who cares? he thought. He was here for Mrs. P. She wanted this so much. Then it was as if Madame Plonk nearly took his next thought directly out of his head.“But wanting is one thing. One can not merely",ME

Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels.“Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!” Dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor.“Dobby will be missed— good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!”“See you later, Dobby!” Harry shouted, and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three at a time.

Harry saw some of the panic he’d been feeling since Saturday night flickering in Cedric’s gray eyes.“Are you sure?” Cedric said in a hushed voice.“Dead sure,” said Harry.“I’ve seen them.”“But how did you find out? We’re not supposed to know.…”“Never mind,” said Harry quickly— he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth.“But I’m not the only one who knows.

Ron goggled at Harry.“What’s got into them?” he demanded. But Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come in through the portrait hole. The time had come for drastic action.“Wait here,” he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati, and said,“Parvati? Will you go to the ball with me?” Parvati went into a fit of giggles.

I mean— they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety.…”“Eat dung, Malfoy!” said Ron, the same color as the dress robes as he snatched them back out of Malfoy’s grip. Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.“So… going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name? There’s money involved as well, you know… you’d be able to afford some decent robes if you won.…”“What are you talking about?” snapped Ron.“Are you going to enter?” Malfoy repeated.“I suppose you will, Potter?

In front of them was a pair of tired and grumpy- looking wizards, one of whom was holding a large gold watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly: The man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thigh- length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.“Morning, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured football.“Hello there, Arthur,” said Basil wearily.“Not on duty, eh?

They picked up their instruments, and Harry, who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming, suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out, and that the other champions and their partners were standing up.“Come on!” Parvati hissed.“We’re supposed to dance!” Harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up. The Weird Sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune; Harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone’s eye(he could see Seamus and Dean waving at him and sniggering), and next moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed one around her waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers.

They were to stay on the ridge until the rest of the chaw returned.“You mean to tell me you don’t know?”“Not exactly.”“You did a reverse loop to escape the pull and as you were coming out of it this coal flew by. Bubo said he never saw a coal of that size go up so high, but you caught it! Caught it on the loop, Soren. I mean it was better flying than anything Ruby has ever done. It was absolutely spectacular.”“Great Glaux, I wish I’d seen it,” Soren said. Martin hooted loudly.“You did it, Soren! You did it!” Otulissa flew in next with Ruby and Poot.

Never heard such a bunch of babble in my life.” It was Elsie, a rather bunchy- looking Barred Owl, who seemed to have more feathers than her small body could manage. The bar designs on her wings had almost faded into a blur. But she was a kindly old bird, who, along with Matron, was in charge of the care and feeding of all the newly arrived young owlets at the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. Never before had the two owls been actually brought out to a gathering station on a search- and- rescue mission, however.“Over here, Twilight,” Matron called.“I have just fluffed up a place. That Sooty will fit in nicely. Elsie dear, spare me a bit more down for this Sooty.” Elsie obliged by plucking out some downy fluff from beneath her primaries. Twilight blinked. It was just as Elsie said. A low babble came in a steady stream from the little owlets, and they were all reciting some kind of poetry, and it made absolutely no sense to Twilight. One little Grass Owl was now chanting in a thin little voice,“Tytos now forever, so pure, so rare! Yet supreme!” A Masked Owl spoke of a Tyto to whom righteousness belonged and still another was crying out,“Oh, Tyto, who is pureness beyond compare, show thyself… Tyto, how long shall the impure triumph?”“Depressing little ditties, aren’t they?” Bubo said as he lighted down next to Twilight.“What are they talking",Matron

Then, as he strode down a long, straight path, he saw movement once again, and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature, one which he had only seen in picture form, in his Monster Book of Monsters. It was a sphinx. It had the body of an over- large lion: great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman. She turned her long, almond- shaped eyes upon Harry as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress. Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.“You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.”“So… so will you move, please?” said Harry, knowing what the answer was going to be.“No,” she said, continuing to pace.“Not unless you can answer my riddle. Answer on your first guess— I let you pass. Answer wrongly— I attack. Remain silent— I will let you walk away from me unscathed.” Harry’s stomach slipped several notches. It was Hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he could keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative route to the center.“Okay,” he said.“Can I hear the riddle?” The sphinx sat down",a woman

When we went for our tour of the guilds, I knew immediately that the harp was for me. As I slipped through the strings from one note to another, climbing the scales, leaping octaves, the vibrations never left me. And the very best part was to try to— oh, how shall I explain— weave the music into Madame Plonk’s voice. So that together the sound of the harp and the sound of Madame Plonk’s voice made something so large and splendid.” Soren blinked. Mrs. P., he thought, had something much better than a gizzard.“Must be off myself,” the other nest snake said cheerily.“I’m just going around to drop in on Octavia, bring her a few well- seasoned milkberries. She does love them so and, as you know, she does keep the nest for Madame Plonk. Never can hurt, can it? Ta- ta!” And she slithered out of the hollow. Soren wedged himself into a corner where he wouldn’t be seen. But he heard Mrs. P. muttering after the other snake was out of earshot.“To presume to have a gizzard and then go slithering off to Octavia, humming tunes and besieging her with milkberries. Well, I never!” Soren decided to skip visiting Mrs. P. He knew what he must do. He must“drop by” Madame Plonk’s, and he must tell her that here was a very special snake, a snake that had something even finer than a gizzard, a snake of the highest— what was that word Mrs. P. was always using?—“Sensibilities, artistic sensibilities.” CHAPTER NINETEEN A Visit to Madame Plonk You see, Madame Plonk, I know that perhaps",the other nest snake

Seamus was still wearing his Ireland rosette. Some of its magic seemed to be wearing off now; it was still squeaking“Troy— Mullet— Moran!” but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way. After half an hour or so, Hermione, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried herself once more in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a Summoning Charm. Neville listened jealously to the others’ conversation as they relived the Cup match.“Gran didn’t want to go,” he said miserably.“Wouldn’t buy tickets. It sounded amazing though.”“It was,” said Ron.“Look at this, Neville.…” He rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature figure of Viktor Krum.“Oh wow,” said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum onto his pudgy hand.“We saw him right up close, as well,” said Ron.“We were in the Top Box—”“For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.” Draco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway. Behind him stood Crabbe and Goyle, his enormous, thuggish cronies, both of whom appeared to have grown at least a foot during the summer. Evidently they had overheard the conversation through the compartment door, which Dean and Seamus had left ajar.“Don’t",Neville

Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open. It was hollow and completely empty— but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw.“Shut it!” Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again.“Sounded like a banshee.… Maybe you’ve got to get past one of those next, Harry!”“It was someone being tortured!” said Neville, who had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor.“You’re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse!”“Don’t be a prat, Neville, that’s illegal,” said George.“They wouldn’t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing… maybe you’ve got to attack him while he’s in the shower, Harry.”“Want a jam tart, Hermione?” said Fred.

Oh, no, Soren thought. Will I ever understand this owl? Ezylryb was making his way down the line of buckets now. As he came next to the bucket where Soren had dropped his coal, he turned to look at him. The coal he held in his beak cast an eerie glow on his whiskered face. His amber eyes appeared red.“I hear you did a fair night’s work,” he mumbled through the coal. Then added,“Magnificent, perhaps.” He dropped the coal in the bucket and flew off to confer with Poot. They began their homeward journey with just an hour to spare before First Light.“Don’t worry about crows and mobbing,” Elvan said.“They never come near when we’re carrying live coals.” It was a beautiful time to fly. The air grew fresher and a light wind now ruffled the water into lacy crests. Even now, with the coals and cinders tame in the buckets, their power seemed to touch them. Fire, of course, was perhaps the most important element that made the Great Ga’Hoole Tree different from any other kingdom of owls. It made them more than a community or a gathering of owls. It made them a fellowship. And if they were to rise each night into the blackness and perform noble deeds, it was perhaps the fire that helped them do this: fire punched up to fierce heats with Bubo’s bellows for forging metals into battle claws; fire tamed",Elvan

Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire.

He lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since.

Perhaps it was the melting ice that made him think of that warmer place with the pools of crystal- clear water, his lovely white face shimmering on the surface. Why couldn’t they go back there? Where were they supposed to be going instead? Soren kept forgetting. All he could remember were the rolls of warm wind to play on, the still, glasslike lake, the everlasting summer. No ice, no blizzard. Why not live there happily ever after? The dream tugged on him.

His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.“They need squeezing.

As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol.

There’s a tailwind. I’ll slam beak- first into it. Then where will your dinner be? If you’re so smart you come down and go fishing yourself.”“Oh, sorry, dear, silly me.” Then he turned to the owls.“We’re really not that bright.

Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey, beaming widely, took off the hat, placed it back on the stool, and hurried over to join his brother.“Colin, I fell in!” he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty seat.“It was brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!”“Cool!” said Colin, just as excitedly.“It was probably the giant squid, Dennis!”“Wow!” said Dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a storm- tossed, fathoms- deep lake, and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster.“Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one with the black hair and glasses? See him? Know who he is, Dennis?” Harry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now Sorting Emma Dobbs. The Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to the three- legged stool, the line dwindling slowly as Professor McGonagall passed the L’s.“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.“Now, Ron, the Sorting’s much more important than food,” said Nearly Headless Nick as“Madley, Laura!” became a Hufflepuff.“’ Course it is, if you’re dead,” snapped Ron.“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,” said Nearly Headless Nick, applauding as“McDonald, Natalie!” joined the Gryffindor table.“We do",Colin

I have been here much longer than you and still have not yet become a member of a chaw.”“What’s a chaw?” Soren said.“You are selected to join a chaw— a small team of owls— and you will learn a skill that is helpful.”“In battle?” Twilight asked.“Not just battle— in life.

Would he be up to it? He had to be. With his friends, he could. Look what they had accomplished so far!“Do we all get to be in the same chaw?” Soren asked.“Probably not.”“But we’re a band.” Soren hoped that he did not sound as if he were pleading.“That doesn’t matter now.

I’ll just hang here, wide open, until you get back, shall I?”“Yeah, thanks!” Ron shouted over his shoulder.“Hermione, where are we going?” Harry asked, after she had led them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.“You’ll see, you’ll see in a minute!” said Hermione excitedly. She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and Harry’s names.

He turned his head and called across the common room,“Oi! Angelina!” Angelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over at him.“What?” she called back.“Want to come to the ball with me?” Angelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look.“All right, then,” she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face.“There you go,” said Fred to Harry and Ron,“piece of cake.” He got to his feet, yawning, and said,“We’d better use a school owl then, George, come on.…” They left. Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at Harry.“We should get a move on, you know… ask someone. He’s right.

There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail spoke again.“My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?”“A week,” said the cold voice.“Perhaps longer. The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan can not proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.” Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word“Quidditch,” which was not a word at all.“The— the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said Wormtail.(Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.)“Forgive me, but— I do not understand— why should we wait until the World Cup is over?”“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, checking and double- checking identities. They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait.” Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words“Ministry of Magic,”“wizards,” and“Muggles.” Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals.

In front of them was a pair of tired and grumpy- looking wizards, one of whom was holding a large gold watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly: The man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thigh- length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.“Morning, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured football.“Hello there, Arthur,” said Basil wearily.“Not on duty, eh? It’s all right for some.… We’ve been here all night.… You’d better get out of the way, we’ve got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five- fifteen. Hang on, I’ll find your campsite.… Weasley… Weasley…” He consulted his parchment list.“About a quarter of a mile’s walk over there, first field you come to. Site manager’s called Mr. Roberts.

Last time I ever tried that.,43201,43255,True,219:Poot.?,"the young owls in the weather chaw seemed to have diminished in size. Their feathers were pulled, in tightly indications that the owls were very nervous about their first weather flight. When relaxed, an owl’s plumage is loose and fluffy. When angered, owls can puff up their feathers until they appear much, much larger. But now it was as if they had all become suddenly slim. The tension hovered in the air. Ezylryb fixed the young owls in the amber light of his squinted eye.“Eat up, maties… every single little hair. You’ve forgotten what raw meat tastes like with the fur, as you call it. Poot here is my first mate. He’ll tell you what it’s like to fly with no ballast in your gizzard.”“I remember that time before I had acquired the taste for hair and thought I could go through that hurricane. Last time I ever tried that. Nearly got caught in the rim of the eye, I did. Now, you don’t want to do that, young’uns.” Poot was a Boreal Owl like Soren and Gylfie’s old friend Grimble.“What happens if you get caught in the rim of the eye of a hurricane?” asked Rudy.“Oh, you spin around till you’re dead. Just around and around and around. Awful nasty way to go. Usually get your wings torn off in the process,” said Poot.“Now, don’t go scaring them, Poot,” Octavia said and gave a ripple so that all their plates clattered a bit.“And please, young’uns, don’t try that trick of slipping the fur under the table. Remember, I am the table and it itches something fierce.” It was not even dark yet, but the weather chaw owls were already on the takeoff limb",Poot

Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered.“I told you… it was an accident.…”“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back.“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman… but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays on, you don’t need to be a genius to tell which one’s the better flier!”“Must be nearly time,” said Mr. Weasley quickly, pulling out his watch again.“Do you know whether we’re waiting for any more, Amos?”“No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts couldn’t get tickets,” said Mr. Diggory.“There aren’t any more of us in this area, are there?”“Not that I know of,” said Mr. Weasley.“Yes, it’s a minute off.… We’d better get ready.…” He looked around at Harry and Hermione.“You just need to touch the Portkey, that’s all, a finger will do—” With difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the nine of them crowded around the old boot held",Amos Diggory

They stood there looking at each other, and then Cho said,“Well—”“Yeah,” said Harry.“Well,’ bye,” said Cho, still very red. She walked away. Harry called after her, before he could stop himself.“Who’re you going with?”“Oh— Cedric,” she said.“Cedric Diggory.”“Oh right,” said Harry. His insides had come back again. It felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence. Completely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to Gryffindor Tower, Cho’s voice echoing in his ears with every step he took.“Cedric— Cedric Diggory.” He had been starting to quite like Cedric— prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at Quidditch, and was handsome, and popular, and nearly everyone’s favorite champion. Now he suddenly realized that Cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who didn’t have enough brains to fill an eggcup.“Fairy lights,” he said dully to the Fat Lady— the password had been changed the previous day.“Yes, indeed",Cho

The man with the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse— with amusement. He was dangerous— a madman. And he was planning more murders— this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was— was in danger— Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village… but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.“One more murder… my faithful servant at Hogwarts… Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will be no more argument. But quiet… I think I hear Nagini.…” And the second man’s voice changed. He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure. And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright. Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long.

Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket, then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying“the Burrow!” Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering gasp. There was a whooshing sound, and Fred vanished.“Right then, George,” said Mr. Weasley,“you and the trunk.” Harry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better. Then, with a second whoosh, George had cried“the Burrow!” and vanished too.“Ron, you next,” said Mr. Weasley.“See you,” said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He grinned broadly at Harry, then stepped into the fire, shouted“the Burrow!” and disappeared. Now Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained.“Well…’ bye then,” Harry said to the Dursleys.

Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw table, where everyone was applauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down. For a fleeting second, Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.“Baddock, Malcolm!”“SLYTHERIN!” The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins. Harry wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other.

Soren thought of his own face, covered in pure white feathers. This was the most distinctive feature of Barn Owls, and he really did not want to think of it growing singed and sooty. Maybe he was vain but he couldn’t help it.“Pay attention! Soren!” Elvan barked.“You nearly ran into Otulissa.” Thank Glaux she couldn’t speak, thought Soren. That was the only good thing about colliering. It was hard to speak with a live coal in one’s mouth. So Otulissa was effectively shut up for once.“All right, rest time. Drop your coals,” Elvan announced. Rest wasn’t really rest, however, as the ryb lectured them the entire time.“Tomorrow you shall begin flying with the coals in your beaks.

Fleur had many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn, but she didn’t seem to care, nor would she allow Madam Pomfrey to clean them.“Look after Gabrielle,” she told her, and then she turned to Harry.“You saved’ er,” she said breathlessly.“Even though she was not your’ ostage.”“Yeah,” said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he’d left all three girls tied to the statue.

The moon was beginning to slip away, and Mags had begun to pack up her wares. It would be time for good light, but suddenly Soren noticed that Eglantine was not by his side.

Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered.“I told you… it was an accident.…”“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back.“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman… but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh?

And he was planning more murders— this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was— was in danger— Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village… but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.“One more murder… my faithful servant at Hogwarts… Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will be no more argument. But quiet… I think I hear Nagini.…” And the second man’s voice changed. He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure. And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright. Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer and closer— What was he to do?

In a very haughty voice she said,“You have not been tempered by battle yet. Nor do you know the first thing about strategy. You probably don’t even know how to fly with battle claws. I have been here much longer than you and still have not yet become a member of a chaw.”“What’s a chaw?” Soren said.“You are selected to join a chaw— a small team of owls— and you will learn a skill that is helpful.”“In battle?” Twilight asked.“Not just battle— in life. There is more to life than just battles. Each chaw has its own, oh, how should I put it? Personality.

Would he be up to it? He had to be. With his friends, he could. Look what they had accomplished so far!“Do we all get to be in the same chaw?” Soren asked.“Probably not.”“But we’re a band.” Soren hoped that he did not sound as if he were pleading.“That doesn’t matter now.

It was dull work, requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles.“I’ve got two Neptunes here,” said Harry after a while, frowning down at his piece of parchment,“that can’t be right, can it?”“Aaaaah,” said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney’s mystical whisper,“when two Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, Harry…” Seamus and Dean, who were working nearby, sniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from Lavender Brown—“Oh Professor, look! I think I’ve got an unaspected planet! Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?”“It is Uranus, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, peering down at the chart.“Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?” said Ron. Most unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him, and it was this, perhaps, that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class.“A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you, with reference to your personal chart,” she snapped, sounding much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy- fairy self.“I want it ready to hand in next Monday, and no excuses!”“Miserable old bat,” said Ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner.“",Lavender Brown

“No!,57086,57091,True,710:another owl.F,"was something about Tytos, or Barn Owls. Then overhead, Soren heard the arrival of a new batch of owlets being brought in. There was no quiet flying this day. Owls that once prided themselves on silent flight beat their wings furiously, in their desperate efforts to get the injured owlets to safety.“SOREN!” The sound of his own name split the warm air. Soren looked up from his task of pecking out worms. It was Twilight who had called down to him and he was flanked by Primrose and Digger. The rest of the search- and- rescue chaw was following.“Soren, get up here fast as you can,” Twilight called again. Then Digger spiraled down.“This is important. Bring that worm and come on.”“No! No!” another owl said tersely.“All worms must be put into the pile first. Our chaw ryb said so.”“Drop the worm, Soren, and just come.” Soren couldn’t imagine what could be so important that they needed him so quickly. He followed Digger to a new hollow they had just fixed up to take care of the overflow from the infirmary. Outside the hollow, Gylfie and Primrose perched on a branch. They were very still. Soren got an awful feeling in his gizzard. He hesitated. He really did not want to go into that hollow. Digger gave him a bit of a nudge. Then Gylfie came up on the other side. The shadows from the hollow seemed to draw him in against his will. He blinked. Twilight stood",another owl

Down below, it appeared that the female was trying to run across the surface of the water while madly flapping her wings.“Water takeoff— not easy for any of us. We’re not the best fliers, but, as you can see, we can dive. Got these little air pockets so we can go really deep for a long, long time. Getting back to the nest is the hardest part for us.” The male stepped out of the ice hollow and called down.“Dearest, try that patch over there under the lee, the water is smoother.” She gave her mate a withering glance, and somehow through the mouthful of fish yelled back,“You want me to fly directly into the wall, Puff Head! There’s a tailwind. I’ll slam beak- first into it. Then where will your dinner be? If you’re so smart you come down and go fishing yourself.”“Oh, sorry, dear, silly me.” Then he turned to the owls.“We’re really not that bright. I mean we dive well, know how to fish, and deal with ice, but that’s about it.” But, in fact, the puffins knew more and were not that dumb at all.“Just low self- esteem,” Gylfie said. The puffins, in addition to knowing how to dive and fish, knew weather. And just now they were telling them that there would be a small pocket of time when the wind would turn, and they could leave before the next storm came in.“You see, young’uns,” said the male puffin,“nine days out often, the wind slams full force up",the female

Nearly got caught in the rim of the eye, I did. Now, you don’t want to do that, young’uns.” Poot was a Boreal Owl like Soren and Gylfie’s old friend Grimble.“What happens if you get caught in the rim of the eye of a hurricane?” asked Rudy.“Oh, you spin around till you’re dead. Just around and around and around. Awful nasty way to go. Usually get your wings torn off in the process,” said Poot.“Now, don’t go scaring them, Poot,” Octavia said and gave a ripple so that all their plates clattered a bit.“And please, young’uns, don’t try that trick of slipping the fur under the table. Remember, I am the table and it itches something fierce.” It was not even dark yet, but the weather chaw owls were already on the takeoff limb. It was all they could do to hang on as the gale lashed about them and the limb bucked in the turbulent wind. Shards of ice flew through the air.“We take off upwind, naturally.” Although Soren was not sure in this gale which way upwind even was.“We’re going to fly straight out over the Sea of Hoolemere. Try to find the main part of the gale.” Ezylryb spoke in short snappish sentences.“Now listen up. Here’s what you need to know about a gale, or any storm, really— except for hurricanes— they be a little different with their eyes and all. But what you got in a gale",Octavia

About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming— a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature. He winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim opened wide—“GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted. Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey, beaming widely, took off the hat, placed it back on the stool, and hurried over to join his brother.“Colin, I fell in!” he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty seat.“It was brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!”“Cool!” said Colin, just as excitedly.“It was probably the giant squid, Dennis!”“Wow!” said Dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a storm- tossed, fathoms- deep lake, and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster.“Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one with the black hair and glasses? See him? Know who he is, Dennis?” Harry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now Sorting Emma Dobbs.

The bell was due to ring at any moment, and Harry and Ron, who had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George’s fake wands at the back of the class, looked up, Ron holding a tin parrot and Harry, a rubber haddock.“Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age,” said Professor McGonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of Harry’s haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor— Ron’s parrot’s beak had severed it moments before—“I have something to say to you all.“The Yule Ball is approaching— a traditional part of the Tri- wizard Tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests. Now, the ball will be open only to fourth years and above— although you may invite a younger student if you wish—” Lavender Brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati Patil nudged her hard in the ribs, her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle. They both looked around at Harry. Professor McGonagall ignored them, which Harry thought was distinctly unfair, as she had just told off him and Ron.“Dress robes will be worn,” Professor McGonagall continued,“and the ball will start at eight o’clock on Christmas Day, finishing at midnight in the Great Hall.

Yet as they drew closer to the opposite shore, the air did seem different. And although Soren, like other owls, did not have the keenest sense of smell, the air seemed tinged with an acrid odor. They landed on the ridge of some high cliffs. Ezylryb was already pointing with his three- taloned foot to some clouds just beyond the ridge.“We call them Ga’Hoole clouds. You know why?” Otulissa’s talon shot up.“Because they are the shape of the seeds found in the Ga’Hoole fruits.”“Right- o, missy,” Ezylryb said. Martin gave a little sigh.“She never stops, does she?” It was clear that Martin was very nervous. More nervous than the others. Soren felt bad for him. He was the smallest owl in the chaw. It had to be scary.“Don’t worry, Martin. You’re going to be all right.”“Soren, that’s kind of you, but do you realize that I am the first Saw- whet to ever be in the colliering chaw?”“They must think you’re special, Martin,” Soren said.“But what if I’m not?” Martin said, a squeak of desperation creeping into his voice.

Search- and- rescue’s coming in with two more little ones. Nest decimation.” Another Short- eared Owl flew by with a wad of something fluffy in her talons.“Oh, no!

Can you show these new arrivals to that hollow we cleaned out yesterday?”“Certainly, Matron.”“And see if Cook has any tea or cakes left over. They look half starved.”“Certainly.” The Spotted Owl named Otulissa showed them to their hollow.“What is going on here?” Twilight asked her.“Oh, there’ve been some skirmishes up in the borderlands, nothing too serious.”“Is it St. Aggie’s?” Soren asked.“We know all about St. Aggie’s.

There is nothing that noble about slaughtering two bad owls in the desert.” The Spotted Owl rose up to her full height and looked down her beak at Gylfie. In a very haughty voice she said,“You have not been tempered by battle yet. Nor do you know the first thing about strategy. You probably don’t even know how to fly with battle claws. I have been here much longer than you and still have not yet become a member of a chaw.”“What’s a chaw?” Soren said.“You are selected to join a chaw— a small team of owls— and you will learn a skill that is helpful.”“In battle?” Twilight asked.“Not just battle— in life. There is more to life than just battles. Each chaw has its own, oh, how should I put it? Personality. Navigation chaw tends to have a kind of elegance, they are all superb flyers, as are the members of search- and- rescue, but they, of course, are less refined. Weather interpretation and colliering are decidely rough and uncouth. But,” and the Spotted Owl fixed a very intense gaze on Twilight,“they are all fiercely brave and can fight or fly to the death!” Twilight seemed to swell in anticipation, but Soren almost shrank with fear. Would he be up to it? He had to be. With his friends, he could. Look what they had accomplished so far!“Do we all get to be in the same chaw?” Soren asked.“Probably not.”“But we’re a band.” Soren hoped that he did not sound as if he were pleading.“That doesn’t matter now.

The time had come for drastic action.“Wait here,” he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati, and said,“Parvati?

Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone can not satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with both boys’ affections. Krum, who is openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has“never felt this way about any other girl.” However, it might not be Miss Granger’s doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys’ interest.“She’s really ugly,” says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourth- year student,“but she’d be well up to making a Love Potion, she’s quite brainy. I think that’s how she’s doing it.” Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims. In the meantime, Harry Potter’s well- wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate.“I told you!” Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article.“I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter!

Why were new coals from a new fire needed?

You are right, it is very possible to keep fires going forever and that is fine for some things— things like cooking and warming up a hollow.

After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon. They said good- bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door. A man was standing in the doorway",Basil

You’ve forgotten what raw meat tastes like with the fur, as you call it. Poot here is my first mate. He’ll tell you what it’s like to fly with no ballast in your gizzard.”“I remember that time before I had acquired the taste for hair and thought I could go through that hurricane. Last time I ever tried that. Nearly got caught in the rim of the eye, I did. Now, you don’t want to do that, young’uns.” Poot was a Boreal Owl like Soren and Gylfie’s old friend Grimble.“What happens if you get caught in the rim of the eye of a hurricane?” asked Rudy.“Oh, you spin around till you’re dead. Just around and around and around. Awful nasty way to go. Usually get your wings torn off in the process,” said Poot.“Now, don’t go scaring them, Poot,” Octavia said and gave a ripple so that all their plates clattered a bit.“And please, young’uns, don’t try that trick of slipping the fur under the table. Remember, I am the table and it itches something fierce.” It was not even dark yet, but the weather chaw owls were already on the takeoff limb. It was all they could do to hang on as the gale lashed about them and the limb bucked in the turbulent wind. Shards of ice flew through the air.“We take off upwind, naturally.” Although Soren was not sure in this gale which way upwind even was.“We’re going to fly straight out over the Sea of Hoolemere.",Poot

But he heard Mrs. P. muttering after the other snake was out of earshot.“To presume to have a gizzard and then go slithering off to Octavia, humming tunes and besieging her with milkberries. Well, I never!” Soren decided to skip visiting Mrs. P. He knew what he must do. He must“drop by” Madame Plonk’s, and he must tell her that here was a very special snake, a snake that had something even finer than a gizzard, a snake of the highest— what was that word Mrs. P. was always using?—“Sensibilities, artistic sensibilities.” CHAPTER NINETEEN A Visit to Madame Plonk You see, Madame Plonk, I know that perhaps this is not proper— me coming to you this way.” Soren could hardly keep his mind on what he was saying, as he had never in his life seen a hollow like this one. The air spun with colored light from the whirlyglasses that hung from the ceiling and sometimes jutted out from the walls, suspended on twigs jammed into cracks. There were several openings through which light poured. There were pieces of cloth embroidered with beautiful designs and one little niche spilled over with strands of luminous beads. Indeed, the hollow seemed to swirl with color. And in the middle of all this color there was a dazzling whiteness— Madame Plonk. Soren gulped and tried to keep his eyes from straying from that whiteness.“But I just know that Mrs. P. is rather shy and would never dare.”“Mrs. P.?” Madame Plonk broke in.“I don’t believe I know this snake.”“She came with me, ma’am. She’s my family’s old nest- maid snake.”“Oh, and you were saying that she wants to be in the harp guild?”“Yes, ma’am.” Soren thought he sounded so stupid. Who cares? he thought. He was here for Mrs. P. She wanted this so much. Then it was as if Madame Plonk nearly took his next thought directly out of his head.“But wanting is one thing. One can not merely",ME

For twilight was upon them. CHAPTER THIRTEEN Books of the Yonder Now, young ones, please follow me as we explore the wondrous root structure of our dear tree. You see where the roots bump up from the ground.” It was the Ga’Hoolology ryb, a boring old Burrowing Owl.“Here’s one.”“Oh, yes, Otulissa. A perfect example.”“Here’s one,” Gylfie mimicked Otulissa.“She has the most annoying voice.”“Now if we can find a pellet or if someone would care to yarp one, I shall demonstrate the proper burying technique. Pellets properly buried nourish the tree,” the ryb continued.“Oh, I’ll find you one,” Otulissa quickly volunteered and bustled off.“This is the most borrring class,” sighed Soren. They had been stomping around the base of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree all during twilight.“I don’t think it’s that bad,” said Digger. Digger, of course, being a Burrowing Owl, preferred ground activities.“I don’t know what I’ll do if I am tapped for Ga’Hoolol- ogy,” Twilight muttered.“You? Never,” Soren said, but he was secretly worried that he might be. He realized that knowing about the tree was important.

He found it hard to concentrate on Snape’s Potions test, and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient— a bezoar— meaning that he received bottom marks. He didn’t care, though; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the dungeon door.“I’ll meet you at dinner,” he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off upstairs. He’d just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all.… He hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her, and(rather sooner than he had expected) he found her, emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.“Er— Cho? Could I have a word with you?” Giggling should be made illegal, Harry thought furiously, as all the girls around Cho started doing it. She didn’t, though. She said,“Okay,” and followed him out of earshot of her classmates. Harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs.“Er,” he said. He couldn’t ask her. He couldn’t. But he had to. Cho stood there looking puzzled, watching him. The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them.“Wangoballwime?”“Sorry?” said Cho.“D’you— d’you want to go to the ball with me?” said Harry. Why did he have to go red now?

Why couldn’t they go back there? Where were they supposed to be going instead? Soren kept forgetting. All he could remember were the rolls of warm wind to play on, the still, glasslike lake, the everlasting summer. No ice, no blizzard. Why not live there happily ever after? The dream tugged on him. In his sleep, he felt his gizzard turn and something begin to dim, while the longing for The Beaks and the Mirror Lakes grew stronger and stronger.“Time to get up, young’uns.” It was the male puffin, nudging Soren with one of his large, orange, webbed feet.“Wind died down. You can fly out of here now. The wall’s weeping.”“Huh?” Soren asked.“What do you mean the wall’s weeping?”“The ice is melting. Means warm air, the thermals have come. Easy flying.” The other owls were already up and standing at the rim of the hollow. The wall certainly was weeping. Glistening with wetness, it appeared shimmering, almost fiery as the setting sun turned its ice into liquid flames of pink, then orange and red.“Dumpy,” his father called.“Come over here, son. I want you to step up here and watch the young’uns fly. They are the masters of silent flight.

What’s that?” Soren asked.“Accidental destruction of nests.” A young Spotted Owl flew up as they landed on a branch midway up the tree.“Otulissa, thank goodness. Can you show these new arrivals to that hollow we cleaned out yesterday?”“Certainly, Matron.”“And see if Cook has any tea or cakes left over. They look half starved.”“Certainly.” The Spotted Owl named Otulissa showed them to their hollow.“What is going on here?” Twilight asked her.“Oh, there’ve been some skirmishes up in the borderlands, nothing too serious.”“Is it St. Aggie’s?” Soren asked.“We know all about St. Aggie’s. Gylfie and I escaped.” Otulissa blinked.“And we killed their top two lieutenants when they came after Digger here. So we’re ready to fight,” Twilight added. The Spotted Owl blinked again.“I mean, we’re in the right place, aren’t we? The Great Ga’Hoole Tree?” Twilight had stepped closer to the owl to ask his question.“Where each night the order of knightly owls rises to perform noble deeds,” Soren offered in a softer voice.

He lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since. There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.“Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn’t.”“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar,“he had a hard war, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to—”“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked the cook.“There’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember! Nobody forced the door last night! No broken windows!

He turned his head and called across the common room,“Oi! Angelina!” Angelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over at him.“What?” she called back.“Want to come to the ball with me?” Angelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look.“All right, then,” she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face.“There you go,” said Fred to Harry and Ron,“piece of cake.” He got to his feet, yawning, and said,“We’d better use a school owl then, George, come on.…” They left. Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at Harry.“We should get a move on, you know… ask someone. He’s right.

As it was Halloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling, while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner. Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering.“There’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in,” Dean told Harry.“That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth.” Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in disgust.“We can’t have a Slytherin champion!”“And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,” said Seamus contemptuously.“But I wouldn’t have thought he’d have wanted to risk his good looks.”“Listen!” said Hermione suddenly.

When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto Dudley’s plate with a tremulous“There you are, Diddy darling,” Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end- of- year report. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn’t understand him, while Uncle Vernon maintained that“he didn’t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway.” They also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report—“He’s a boisterous little boy, but he wouldn’t hurt a fly!” Aunt Petunia had said tearfully. However, at the bottom of the report there were a few well- chosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain away. No matter how much Aunt Petunia wailed that Dudley was big- boned, and that his poundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the school outfitters didn’t stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore. The school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia’s eyes— so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors— simply refused to see: that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer",Aunt Petunia

He saw the Short- eared Owl called Matron who had led them to their own hollow. She was bustling about, plucking down from her own breast and tucking it in around an owl.“Now, now, dear, we know you did your best.”“But what will Mum and Da think?” For a moment Soren’s gizzard gave a lurch. Could this little owl be Eglantine?“They will think that you were a brave little Pygmy Owl,” Matron replied. Soren sighed.“What are you doing out there? Just don’t stand around, come in and make yourself useful,” Matron called. Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed.

She says everyone there is very superstitious, but I don’t know, I guess she just thinks the owls here will laugh at her or something.

He had never felt uncomfortable flying, even when he was diving into the fringes of forest fires to gather coals on colliering missions. But, indeed, he could almost feel the sparks from that comet’s tail. It was as if they were hot sizzling points pinging off his wings, singeing his flight feathers as the infernos of burning forests never had. He carved a great downward arc in the night to try to escape it. Was he becoming like Octavia? Could he actually feel the comet? Impossible!

Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?”“It is Uranus, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, peering down at the chart.“Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?” said Ron. Most unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him, and it was this, perhaps, that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class.“A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you, with reference to your personal chart,” she snapped, sounding much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy- fairy self.“I want it ready to hand in next Monday, and no excuses!”“Miserable old bat,” said Ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner.“",Lavender Brown

Will I ever understand this owl? Ezylryb was making his way down the line of buckets now. As he came next to the bucket where Soren had dropped his coal, he turned to look at him.

It was a good theory, but it wasn’t working very well.

Never heard such a bunch of babble in my life.” It was Elsie, a rather bunchy- looking Barred Owl, who seemed to have more feathers than her small body could manage. The bar designs on her wings had almost faded into a blur. But she was a kindly old bird, who, along with Matron, was in charge of the care and feeding of all the newly arrived young owlets at the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. Never before had the two owls been actually brought out to a gathering station on a search- and- rescue mission, however.“Over here, Twilight,” Matron called.“I have just fluffed up a place. That Sooty will fit in nicely. Elsie dear, spare me a bit more down for this Sooty.” Elsie obliged by plucking out some downy fluff from beneath her primaries. Twilight blinked. It was just as Elsie said. A low babble came in a steady stream from the little owlets, and they were all reciting some kind of poetry, and it made absolutely no sense to Twilight. One little Grass Owl was now chanting in a thin little voice,“Tytos now forever, so pure, so rare! Yet supreme!” A Masked Owl spoke of a Tyto to whom righteousness belonged and still another was crying out,“Oh, Tyto, who is pureness beyond compare, show thyself… Tyto, how long shall the impure triumph?”“Depressing little ditties, aren’t they?” Bubo said as he lighted down next to Twilight.“What are they talking",Matron

Nobody gets left out. Fill me in on the way to whatever we’re doing.” And so the band of four, as quietly as possible, moved out of their hollow with Gylfie in the lead. They left by the sky opening and flew a quarter way down the tree, where they entered a very small opening that Gylfie had discovered, which twisted and turned, pitched and curled through the huge trunk of the tree, until they had wound around to the back side of the Parliament hollow and found themselves actually slightly beneath that hollow, in the root structure of the tree. It was not that the walls were thin, Soren soon realized. It was rather that the roots of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree were transmitting the sounds.

Well, I never!” Soren decided to skip visiting Mrs. P. He knew what he must do. He must“drop by” Madame Plonk’s, and he must tell her that here was a very special snake, a snake that had something even finer than a gizzard, a snake of the highest— what was that word Mrs. P. was always using?—“Sensibilities, artistic sensibilities.” CHAPTER NINETEEN A Visit to Madame Plonk You see, Madame Plonk, I know that perhaps this is not proper— me coming to you this way.” Soren could hardly keep his mind on what he was saying, as he had never in his life seen a hollow like this one. The air spun with colored light from the whirlyglasses that hung from the ceiling and sometimes jutted out from the walls, suspended on twigs jammed into cracks. There were several openings through which light poured. There were pieces of cloth embroidered with beautiful designs and one little niche spilled over with strands of luminous beads. Indeed, the hollow seemed to swirl with color. And in the middle of all this color there was a dazzling whiteness— Madame Plonk. Soren gulped and tried to keep his eyes from straying from that whiteness.“But I just know that Mrs. P. is rather shy and would never dare.”“Mrs. P.?” Madame Plonk broke in.“I don’t believe I know this snake.”“She came with me, ma’am. She’s my family’s old nest- maid snake.”“Oh, and you were saying that she wants to be in the harp guild?”“Yes, ma’am.” Soren thought he sounded so stupid. Who cares? he thought. He was here for Mrs. P. She wanted this so much. Then it was as if Madame Plonk nearly took his next thought directly out of his head.“But wanting is one thing. One can not merely",ME

So Otulissa was effectively shut up for once.“All right, rest time. Drop your coals,” Elvan announced. Rest wasn’t really rest, however, as the ryb lectured them the entire time.“Tomorrow you shall begin flying with the coals in your beaks. It is not that different, really, from walking. Although you must take care to keep your coal alive and burning.”“Yeah!” Bubo boomed.“Dead coals ain’t going to do me a bit of good, young’uns. No sense flying in here with a great lot of ashes, cold as Glaux knows what.”“Yes,” continued Elvan.“We don’t want to disappoint Bubo.”“Oh, Glaux forbid that we should disappoint Bubo,” Otulissa mumbled. Soren stole a glance at her. There was pure venom in her eyes. Why couldn’t she just be angry about being in this chaw? What did Bubo have to do with it? Soren thought. He knew why, of course. Otulissa thought she was too good to have anything to do with Bubo. Neither Bubo nor any of the owls in this chaw had the distinguished background of Otulissa. It was an outrage, as she told Soren forty times a night, that she had not been included in Strix Struma’s navigation chaw.

"You will collect the pus,",64191,64238,True,366:Professor Sprout.F,". Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn’t even got his letter? His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.“They need squeezing. You will collect the pus—”“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout,“and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.”“Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice.“She tried to curse hers off.”“Silly girl,” said Professor Sprout, shaking her head.“",Professor Sprout

In front of them was a pair of tired and grumpy- looking wizards, one of whom was holding a large gold watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly: The man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thigh- length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.“Morning, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured football.“Hello there, Arthur,” said Basil wearily.“Not on duty, eh?

She had said nothing. But now the Elf Owl stepped forward.“Are you trying to tell us we are not ready… that… that it takes more?”“Indeed. There is nothing that noble about slaughtering two bad owls in the desert.” The Spotted Owl rose up to her full height and looked down her beak at Gylfie. In a very haughty voice she said,“You have not been tempered by battle yet. Nor do you know the first thing about strategy. You probably don’t even know how to fly with battle claws. I have been here much longer than you and still have not yet become a member of a chaw.”“What’s a chaw?” Soren said.“You are selected to join a chaw— a small team of owls— and you will learn a skill that is helpful.”“In battle?” Twilight asked.“Not just battle— in life. There is more to life than just battles. Each chaw has its own, oh, how should I put it? Personality.

Could I have a word with you?” Giggling should be made illegal, Harry thought furiously, as all the girls around Cho started doing it. She didn’t, though. She said,“Okay,” and followed him out of earshot of her classmates. Harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs.“Er,” he said. He couldn’t ask her. He couldn’t. But he had to. Cho stood there looking puzzled, watching him. The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them.“Wangoballwime?”“Sorry?” said Cho.“D’you— d’you want to go to the ball with me?” said Harry. Why did he have to go red now? Why?“Oh!” said Cho, and she went red too.“Oh Harry, I’m really sorry,” and she truly looked it.“I’ve already said I’ll go with someone else.”“Oh,” said Harry. It was odd; a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes, but suddenly he didn’t seem to have any insides at all.“Oh okay,” he said,“no problem.”“I’m really sorry,” she said again.“That’s okay,” said Harry.

She just didn’t want to go with Neville… I mean, who would?”“Don’t!” said Ginny, annoyed.“Don’t laugh—” Just then Hermione climbed in through the portrait hole.“Why weren’t you two at dinner?” she said, coming over to join them.“Because— oh shut up laughing, you two— because they’ve both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball!” said Ginny. That shut Harry and Ron up.“Thanks a bunch, Ginny,” said Ron sourly.“All the good- looking ones taken, Ron?” said Hermione loftily.“Eloise Midgen starting to look quite pretty now, is she? Well, I’m sure you’ll find someone somewhere who’ll have you.” But Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light.“Hermione, Neville’s right— you are a girl.…”“Oh well spotted,” she said acidly.“Well— you can come with one of us!”“No, I can’t,” snapped Hermione.“Oh come on,” he said impatiently,“we need partners, we’re going to",Ginny

It was an outrage, as she told Soren forty times a night, that she had not been included in Strix Struma’s navigation chaw. Elvan continued speaking during their break.“And then, of course, after you have had enough nights of weather training we shall find a nice forest fire for you— nothing too big, mind you. Just a nice little beginning fire with a good mix of trees— Ga’Hooles, firs, pine, some soft and hard woods. Not too many ridges or mountains to complicate wind patterns.”“Pardon me,” piped up the little Northern Saw- whet Owl, Martin, who had been rescued the same night as Primrose.“Yes, Martin,” Elvan said.“Well, I don’t understand why we need new coals all the time. Once you start a fire going, wouldn’t there always be new coals?” This was some smart little owl, Soren thought. Why hadn’t the others thought of this question? Why were new coals from a new fire needed? Elvan turned to Bubo.“Bubo, as chief smith, would you care to answer that?”“Sure thing, mate.” Then he stepped up to Martin and, towering over him, began to speak.“A very good question.

The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for Bagman, their faces full of savage triumph. The boy began to scream.“No! Mother, no! I didn’t do it, I didn’t do it, I didn’t know! Don’t send me there, don’t let him!” The dementors were gliding back into the room. The boys’ three companions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy- lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called,“The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban; we will wait! He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!” But the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though Harry could see their cold, draining power starting to affect him.

Can you show these new arrivals to that hollow we cleaned out yesterday?”“Certainly, Matron.”“And see if Cook has any tea or cakes left over. They look half starved.”“Certainly.” The Spotted Owl named Otulissa showed them to their hollow.“What is going on here?” Twilight asked her.“Oh, there’ve been some skirmishes up in the borderlands, nothing too serious.”“Is it St. Aggie’s?” Soren asked.“We know all about St. Aggie’s. Gylfie and I escaped.” Otulissa blinked.“And we killed their top two lieutenants when they came after Digger here. So we’re ready to fight,” Twilight added.

I mean, it’s not really real.”“Well, Sweetums, some say it’s simply invisible.”“What’s simple about being invisible?” Gylfie asked.“Ohh, hooo- hooo.” The two Sooty Owls were convulsed in laughter.“Doesn’t she remind you of Tibby, Swa- tums?” Then there was more cooing and giggling and disgusting preening. Soren felt that Gylfie’s question was a perfectly sensible one. What, indeed, was simple about in- visibleness?“Well, young’uns,” Swatums answered,“there is nothing simple. It’s just that it has been said that the Great Ga’Hoole Tree is invisible. That it grows on the island in the middle of a vast sea, a sea called Hoolemere that is nearly as wide as an ocean. A sea that is always wrapped in fog, an island feathered in blizzards, and a tree veiled in mist.”“So,” said Twilight,“it’s not really invisible, it’s just bad weather.”“Not exactly,” replied Swatums.

They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles’ cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested.“Frank!” cried several people.“Never!” Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener. He lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since. There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.“Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn’t.”“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar,“he had a hard war, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to—”“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked the cook.“There’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember!

Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron, and Hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast- Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn’t suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn’t seem to have mouths.“Ouch!” yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes.“It got me! Hagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.“Its end exploded!” said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid a burn on his hand.“Ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off,” said Hagrid, nodding.“Eurgh!” said Lavender Brown again.“Eurgh, Hagrid, what’s that pointy thing on it?”“Ah, some of’em have got stings,” said Hagrid enthusiastically(Lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box).“I reckon they’re the males.… The females’ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies.… I think they might be ter suck blood.”“Well, I can certainly see why we’re trying to keep them alive,” said Malfoy sarcastically.“Who wouldn’t want pets that can burn, sting, and bite all at once?”“Just because they’re not very pretty, it doesn’t mean they’re not useful,” Hermione snapped.“Dragon blood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t want a dragon for a pet, would you?” Harry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a",Lavender Brown

The house- elves down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich, warming stews and savory puddings, and only Fleur Delacour seemed to be able to find anything to complain about.“It is too’ eavy, all zis’ Ogwarts food,” they heard her saying grumpily as they left the Great Hall behind her one evening(Ron skulking behind Harry, keen not to be spotted by Fleur).“I will not fit into my dress robes!”“Oooh there’s a tragedy,” Hermione snapped as Fleur went out into the entrance hall.“She really thinks a lot of herself, that one, doesn’t she?”“Hermione— who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron. He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it. However, Hermione merely frowned and said,“I’m not telling you, you’ll just make fun of me.”“You’re joking, Weasley!” said Malfoy, behind them.“You’re not telling me someone’s asked that to the ball?

As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.”“Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice.“She tried to curse hers off.”“Silly girl,” said Professor Sprout, shaking her head.“But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end.” A booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds, signaling the end of the lesson, and the class separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for Transfiguration, and the Gryffindors heading in the other direction, down the sloping lawn toward Hagrid’s small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Hagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound, Fang. There were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his collar, apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely.

Makes perfect sense.”“Well, I might not be a giant like you, but I can hear better than any of you. I’m going, too. So count me in,” said Soren.“Me, too.” Digger was stretching his legs and seemed at least half awake.“Do you even know what we’re talking about?” Gylfie turned to the Burrowing Owl.“No, but we’re a band, remember? Nobody gets left out. Fill me in on the way to whatever we’re doing.” And so the band of four, as quietly as possible, moved out of their hollow with Gylfie in the lead. They left by the sky opening and flew a quarter way down the tree, where they entered a very small opening that Gylfie had discovered, which twisted and turned, pitched and curled through the huge trunk of the tree, until they had wound around to the back side of the Parliament hollow and found themselves actually slightly beneath that hollow, in the root structure of the tree. It was not that the walls were thin, Soren soon realized. It was rather that the roots of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree were transmitting the sounds. Gylfie hopped on Twilight’s shoulders and Soren pressed one ear to a root, as did Digger.“And so you say,",the Burrowing Owl

She’s always going on about how I should be upholding the family honor. I’ll just have to— oops.…” Neville’s foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase. There were many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts; it was second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step, but Neville’s memory was notoriously poor. Harry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.“Shut it, you,” said Ron, banging down its visor as they passed.

There was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly well; at least he was now lace- free, although he hadn’t done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs.“I still can’t work out how you two got the best- looking girls in the year,” muttered Dean.“Animal magnetism,” said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his cuffs.

She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady,“Violet’s just told me everything.

The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred; he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed.“How did you do it without getting a beard?

It was all hushed up, though. But he’s made friends with werewolves and giants too. We think he’d do anything for a bit of power.” Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a Dark Art. Indeed, the most famous Parselmouth of our times is none other than You- Know- Who himself. A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue“as worthy of investigation. Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with evildoers.” Similarly,“anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence.” Albus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the Triwizard Tournament.

Meanwhile Madame Maxime was trying to restrain Fleur Delacour, who was quite hysterical, fighting tooth and nail to return to the water.“Gabrielle! Gabrielle! Is she alive? Is she’ urt?”“She’s fine!” Harry tried to tell her, but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk, let alone shout. Percy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the bank(“Gerroff, Percy, I’m all right!”); Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.“It was ze grindylows… zey attacked me… oh Gabrielle, I thought… I thought…”“Come here, you,” said Madam Pomfrey. She seized Harry and pulled him over to Hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat. Steam gushed out of his ears.“Harry, well done!” Hermione cried.“You did it, you found out how all by yourself!”“Well—” said Harry. He would have told her about Dobby, but he had just noticed Karkaroff watching him. He was the only judge who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur’s sister had got back safely.“Yeah, that’s",Fleur

He’s not flying straight at all.”“Which way is he tipping?” Mrs. P. asked.“Downwind,” said Twilight.“Quick!” she ordered.“Let’s get over there. I might be able to help.”“You?” Twilight asked somewhat incredulously.“Remember, dear, how Digger had been asking me to ride on his back in the desert? This might just be the time.” A few seconds later they were coming in on Digger’s upwind wing.“Digger,” Soren said,“we know you’re hurt.”“I don’t know if I can make it,” the Burrowing Owl groaned.“Oh, if I could only walk.”“There’s a stand of trees really close,” Soren said.“Mrs. P. has an idea that might help you.”“What’s that?”“She’s going to get on your good wing. That will tip your injured wing up again, lighten the drag on it. Gylfie meanwhile will fly under your bad wing and create a little updraft for it. It might work.”“I don’t know,” Digger moaned miserably.“Faith, boy! Faith!” exhorted Mrs. Plithiver.“Now let’s get on with it.”“I really don’t think I can make it,” Digger gasped.“You can, boy!

Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered.“I told you… it was an accident.…”“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back.“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman… but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays on, you don’t need to be a genius to tell which one’s the better flier!”“Must be nearly time,” said Mr. Weasley quickly, pulling out his watch again.“Do you know whether we’re waiting for any more, Amos?”“No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts couldn’t get tickets,” said Mr. Diggory.“There aren’t any more of us in this area, are there?”“Not that I know of,” said Mr. Weasley.“Yes, it’s a minute off.… We’d better get ready.…” He looked around at Harry and Hermione.“You just need to touch the Portkey, that’s all, a finger will do—” With difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the nine of them crowded around the old boot held",Amos Diggory

I can’t imagine what it does to the air. I mean, flying through it must be almost impossible. You could never even half guess where the dead falls might be.”“Technically, the fire does that”—Otulissa had caught up with them—“because the fire climbs what is called, according to the literature, a fuel ladder.”“Yes, and think of me,” Martin now spoke.“I am on the ground, supposedly looking for the smallest embers. One of these crowning things happens, and at my weight I get sucked straight up the fuel ladder.”“We all have to spend time on the ground, not just you,” Soren said.“It could happen to any of us. You don’t have to be little.” Martin cocked his head and blinked. He did not look convinced. Although they had yet to be in an actual forest fire, each member of the chaw had a type of coal or ember they were in charge of gathering.

When we went for our tour of the guilds, I knew immediately that the harp was for me. As I slipped through the strings from one note to another, climbing the scales, leaping octaves, the vibrations never left me. And the very best part was to try to— oh, how shall I explain— weave the music into Madame Plonk’s voice. So that together the sound of the harp and the sound of Madame Plonk’s voice made something so large and splendid.” Soren blinked. Mrs. P., he thought, had something much better than a gizzard.“Must be off myself,” the other nest snake said cheerily.“I’m just going around to drop in on Octavia, bring her a few well- seasoned milkberries. She does love them so and, as you know, she does keep the nest for Madame Plonk. Never can hurt, can it? Ta- ta!” And she slithered out of the hollow. Soren wedged himself into a corner where he wouldn’t be seen. But he heard Mrs. P. muttering after the other snake was out of earshot.“To presume to have a gizzard and then go slithering off to Octavia, humming tunes and besieging her with milkberries. Well, I never!” Soren decided to skip visiting Mrs. P. He knew what he must do. He must“drop by” Madame Plonk’s, and he must tell her that here was a very special snake, a snake that had something even finer than a gizzard, a snake of the highest— what was that word Mrs. P. was always using?—“Sensibilities, artistic sensibilities.” CHAPTER NINETEEN A Visit to Madame Plonk You see, Madame Plonk, I know that perhaps",the other nest snake

The Spotted Owl blinked again.“I mean, we’re in the right place, aren’t we? The Great Ga’Hoole Tree?” Twilight had stepped closer to the owl to ask his question.“Where each night the order of knightly owls rises to perform noble deeds,” Soren offered in a softer voice. An uncertain feeling that was not quite a doubt, yet not a real belief, began to stir in Soren’s gizzard.“This is the place?” his voice quavered.“Of course it’s the place,” the Spotted Owl replied.“Then get us some battle claws— we’re ready!” Twilight stomped one talon impatiently.“You’re ready!” Otulissa gasped.“You think just because you escaped and killed two rattlebrained owls, you’re ready?”“And the bobcat,” Soren said.“And the crows,” Digger piped up.“Well, not exactly killed them, but drove them off.” Gylfie was very still, however. She had said nothing. But now the Elf Owl stepped forward.“Are you trying to tell us we are not ready… that… that it takes more?”“Indeed.

We’ve got some wounded owls coming in and I have to arrange for their care.” They were flying up through the branches, following the Short- eared Owl to the hollow that would be theirs.“Matron, we’re going to need moss and down.

Can you show these new arrivals to that hollow we cleaned out yesterday?”“Certainly, Matron.”“And see if Cook has any tea or cakes left over. They look half starved.”“Certainly.” The Spotted Owl named Otulissa showed them to their hollow.“What is going on here?” Twilight asked her.“Oh, there’ve been some skirmishes up in the borderlands, nothing too serious.”“Is it St. Aggie’s?” Soren asked.“We know all about St. Aggie’s.

I mean we dive well, know how to fish, and deal with ice, but that’s about it.” But, in fact, the puffins knew more and were not that dumb at all.“Just low self- esteem,” Gylfie said. The puffins, in addition to knowing how to dive and fish, knew weather. And just now they were telling them that there would be a small pocket of time when the wind would turn, and they could leave before the next storm came in.“You see, young’uns,” said the male puffin,“nine days out often, the wind slams full force up these Ice Narrows. That’s how you got sucked into here in the first place. But on the tenth day, it can turn around and suck you right back out. Nice high stream coming through that could pull you right back to The Beaks, if you want to go that far.” He paused and each of the owls stole a glance at one another. The Beaks sounded lovely.

He chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling.“Very well, very well,” Snape snapped.“Potter, leave your things here, I want you back down here later to test your antidote.”“Please, sir— he’s got to take his things with him,” squeaked Colin.“All the champions—”“Very well!” said Snape.“Potter— take your bag and get out of my sight!” Harry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for the door.

The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning. As it was Halloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling, while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner. Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering.“There’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in,” Dean told Harry.“That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth.” Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in disgust.“We can’t have a Slytherin champion!”“And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,” said Seamus contemptuously.“But I wouldn’t have thought he’d have wanted to risk his good looks.”“Listen!” said Hermione suddenly.

I don’t deserve to live.” Primrose emitted a long sound halfway between a whistle and a wail.“Don’t say that!” Soren exclaimed.“Of course you deserve to live. Every owl deserves to live. That’s why we came here.” Matron stopped what she was doing and cocked her head and regarded the young Barn Owl. Perhaps he was learning; just perhaps he was beginning to catch a glimmer of the true meaning of a noble deed. She would leave him to comfort this little Pygmy Owl and",the little owl

Can’t we go?”“Nonsense. You know how we feel about make- believe.” The little owlet dipped his head in embarrassment.“It’s not make- believe,” said Gylfie.“Oh, you can’t be serious, young’un,” said the male.“It’s just a story, an old legend.”“Let me tell you something,” said the female, who Soren disliked more and more by the second.“It does not do any good to believe in things you can not see, touch, or feel. It is a waste of time. From the look of your flight feathers’ development, not to mention your talons, it is apparent that you are either fly- aways or orphans. Why else would you be out cavorting about the skies at such dangerous hours of the morning? I think your parents would be ashamed of you. I can tell you have good breeding.” She looked directly at Soren and blinked. Soren thought he might explode with anger. How did this owl know what his parents might think? How dare she suggest that she knew them so well that she knew they would be ashamed of him? And then there was a small soft, hissing voice.“I am ashamed of anyone who has eyes and still can not see.” It was Mrs. Plithiver. She slithered from the corner in the hollow.“But, of course, to see with two eyes is a very common thing.”“What is she talking about?” said the male.“What happened to the old days when servants served and were quiet? Imagine a nest- maid going on like this,” said the female.“Oh,",the female

Harry imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to the front of the class, and bringing it down on Snape’s greasy head— And then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on Harry’s thoughts. It was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room, beaming at Harry, and walked up to Snape’s desk at the front of the room.“Yes?” said Snape curtly.“Please, sir, I’m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs.” Snape stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded from his eager face.“Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,” said Snape coldly.“He will come upstairs when this class is finished.” Colin went pink.“Sir— sir, Mr. Bagman wants him,” he said nervously.“All the champions have got to go, I think they want to take photographs.…” Harry would have given anything he owned to have stopped Colin saying those last few words. He chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling.“Very well, very well,” Snape snapped.“Potter, leave your things here, I want you back down here later to test your antidote.”“Please, sir— he’s got to take his things with him,” squeaked Colin.“All the champions—”“Very well!” said Snape.“Potter— take your bag and get out of my sight!” Harry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for",Colin

I can’t imagine what it does to the air. I mean, flying through it must be almost impossible. You could never even half guess where the dead falls might be.”“Technically, the fire does that”—Otulissa had caught up with them—“because the fire climbs what is called, according to the literature, a fuel ladder.”“Yes, and think of me,” Martin now spoke.“I am on the ground, supposedly looking for the smallest embers. One of these crowning things happens, and at my weight I get sucked straight up the fuel ladder.”“We all have to spend time on the ground, not just you,” Soren said.“It could happen to any of us. You don’t have to be little.” Martin cocked his head and blinked. He did not look convinced. Although they had yet to be in an actual forest fire, each member of the chaw had a type of coal or ember they were in charge of gathering. Ruby, being the best flier, would seek airborne embers that were dispersed to the highest parts of the thermal draft columns. Soren and Otulissa were assigned a midpoint position on various sides of the convection column and little Martin was on the ground. But, indeed, they would all have to do a certain amount of groundwork. Soren could not help but think",Martin

Though I must say, neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours.” Fred and George set off for the hospital wing, accompanied by Lee, who was howling with laughter, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione, also chortling, went in to breakfast. The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning. As it was Halloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling, while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner. Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering.“There’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in,” Dean told Harry.“That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth.” Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in disgust.“We can’t have a Slytherin champion!”“And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,” said Seamus contemptuously.“But I wouldn’t have thought he’d have wanted to risk his good looks.”“Listen!” said Hermione suddenly. People were cheering out in the entrance hall. They all swiveled around in their seats and saw Angelina Johnson coming into the Hall, grinning in an embarrassed sort of way. A tall black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Angelina came over to them, sat down, and said,“Well, I’ve done it!

Or you could use Dobby, Harry, I bet he’d do anything to help you. I’m not complaining or anything”— he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his backside—“but I’m aching all over.…”“Well, you keep missing the cushions, don’t you!” said Hermione impatiently, rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the Banishing Spell, which Flitwick had left in a cabinet.“Just try and fall backward!”“Once you’re Stunned, you can’t aim too well, Hermione!” said Ron angrily.“Why don’t you take a turn?”“Well, I think Harry’s got it now, anyway,” said Hermione hastily.“And we don’t have to worry about Disarming, because he’s been able to do that for ages.… I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening.” She looked down the list they had made in the library.“I like the look of this one,” she said,“this Impediment Curse.

The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan can not proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.” Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word“Quidditch,” which was not a word at all.“The— the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said Wormtail.(Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.)“Forgive me, but— I do not understand— why should we wait until the World Cup is over?”“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, checking and double- checking identities. They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait.” Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words“Ministry of Magic,”“wizards,” and“Muggles.” Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of menace in the cold voice now. A slight pause followed— and then Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.“It could be",Frank

Perhaps it was the melting ice that made him think of that warmer place with the pools of crystal- clear water, his lovely white face shimmering on the surface. Why couldn’t they go back there? Where were they supposed to be going instead? Soren kept forgetting. All he could remember were the rolls of warm wind to play on, the still, glasslike lake, the everlasting summer. No ice, no blizzard. Why not live there happily ever after? The dream tugged on him. In his sleep, he felt his gizzard turn and something begin to dim, while the longing for The Beaks and the Mirror Lakes grew stronger and stronger.“Time to get up, young’uns.” It was the male puffin, nudging Soren with one of his large, orange, webbed feet.“Wind died down. You can fly out of here now. The wall’s weeping.”“Huh?” Soren asked.“What do you mean the wall’s weeping?”“The ice is melting. Means warm air, the thermals have come. Easy flying.” The other owls were already up and standing at the rim of the hollow. The wall certainly was weeping. Glistening with wetness, it appeared shimmering, almost fiery as the setting sun turned its ice into liquid flames of pink, then orange and red.“Dumpy,” his father called.“Come over here, son.

Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels.“Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!” Dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor.“Dobby will be missed— good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!”“",the elf

As soon as I got there I just wasn’t frightened at all. And I can’t describe what it’s like to grab the cinders in your beak. It’s…”“Intoxicating,” Otulissa broke in.“Yes, I read about it. You must be careful, though. Strix Emerilla wrote that some colliers get so drunk on the cinders that they do not heed weather warnings.”“Well, it’s very strange the feeling you get when you grab them and then fly with them. It’s something,” he paused.“Something very powerful.”“Now’s the time, Soren. You’re going in!” Elvan ordered.“What about me?” Otulissa wailed.“Shut your beak, your turn will come,” Bubo yelled. Soren pitched into a spiraling downward twist. He felt himself buffeted by a sudden fierce updraft, but he had gathered enough speed to bore through it. Then he was on the ground. It was a strange landscape. Charred skeletons of trees clawed the night, and then scattered about were the coals like hot glowing rocks. They were told to work quickly but at the same time not to rush. A steady pace is the best pace, Bubo had told them. How had Martin, so little, done it and found cinders perfectly sized for his beak?

They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles’ cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested.“Frank!” cried several people.“Never!” Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener. He lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since. There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.“Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn’t.”“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar,“he had a hard war, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to—”“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked the cook.“There’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember! Nobody forced the door last night! No broken windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping.…” The villagers exchanged dark looks.“I always thought he had a nasty look about him, right enough,” grunted a man at the bar.“War turned him funny, if you ask me,” said the landlord.“",the cook

There is nothing that noble about slaughtering two bad owls in the desert.” The Spotted Owl rose up to her full height and looked down her beak at Gylfie. In a very haughty voice she said,“You have not been tempered by battle yet. Nor do you know the first thing about strategy. You probably don’t even know how to fly with battle claws. I have been here much longer than you and still have not yet become a member of a chaw.”“What’s a chaw?” Soren said.“You are selected to join a chaw— a small team of owls— and you will learn a skill that is helpful.”“In battle?” Twilight asked.“Not just battle— in life. There is more to life than just battles. Each chaw has its own, oh, how should I put it? Personality. Navigation chaw tends to have a kind of elegance, they are all superb flyers, as are the members of search- and- rescue, but they, of course, are less refined. Weather interpretation and colliering are decidely rough and uncouth. But,” and the Spotted Owl fixed a very intense gaze on Twilight,“they are all fiercely brave and can fight or fly to the death!” Twilight seemed to swell in anticipation, but Soren almost shrank with fear. Would he be up to it? He had to be. With his friends, he could. Look what they had accomplished so far!“Do we all get to be in the same chaw?” Soren asked.“Probably not.”“But we’re a band.” Soren hoped that he did not sound as if he were pleading.“That doesn’t matter now. You’re part of a larger band. I have to go.”“Duty calls, I suppose,” Gylfie said with a slight edge in her voice.",the Spotted Owl

There she is!” Gylfie said.“Good old Ma,” Dumpy sighed.“Hope she brought some capelin. I just love capelin. If you don’t like it, will you give me yours? Please, please, please?”“Sure,” Soren said. Every minute that he stayed in this smelly hollow he was getting less hungry.“Look at that,” Twilight said.“How’s she going to get off?” The others now crowded to the edge of the ice hollow. Down below, it appeared that the female was trying to run across the surface of the water while madly flapping her wings.“Water takeoff— not easy for any of us. We’re not the best fliers, but, as you can see, we can dive. Got these little air pockets so we can go really deep for a long, long time. Getting back to the nest is the hardest part for us.” The male stepped out of the ice hollow and called down.“Dearest, try that patch over there under the lee, the water is smoother.” She gave her mate a withering glance, and somehow through the mouthful of fish yelled back,“You want me to fly directly into the wall, Puff Head! There’s a tailwind. I’ll slam beak- first into it. Then where will your dinner be? If you’re so smart you come down and go fishing yourself.”“Oh, sorry, dear, silly me.” Then he turned to the owls.“We’re really not that bright.

He was not burning, and there was this wonderful glowing thing in his beak that, indeed, seemed to flood his entire being with an extraordinary feeling. It was as if every single one of his hollow bones, every feather shaft brimmed with this feeling of transcendent power. Joy filled him, a joy such as he had never felt since perhaps the first time he had ever flown. But how he got this coal was still a mystery to him. He flew back to the ridge where the buckets were. Martin was beside him.“You were spectacular, Soren. I was so nervous when I saw that crown fire break and then when we saw you getting sucked up, I nearly went yeep.”“But what happened?” Soren asked. They were to stay on the ridge until the rest of the chaw returned.“You mean to tell me you don’t know?”“Not exactly.”“You did a reverse loop to escape the pull and as you were coming out of it this coal flew by. Bubo said he never saw a coal of that size go up so high, but you caught it! Caught it on the loop, Soren. I mean it was better flying than anything Ruby has ever done.

A sleeve of Ron’s dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious. Ron made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy was too quick for him; he seized the sleeve and pulled.“Look at this!” said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron’s robes and showing Crabbe and Goyle,“Weasley, you weren’t thinking of wearing these, were you?

This was not the first time a nest- maid snake had shaken off teacups. There were not many rules at the Great Ga’Hoole Tree but, as Matron instructed the young owls, there were to be no wet poop jokes anywhere, and especially not in the dining hollow. Therefore, the nest snakes were under orders, if it was teatime and they were serving, to immediately dismiss the culprits, and this was accomplished in just the manner Mrs. P. had done when she shook herself. They were ordered to go see Boron and Barran. As could be expected, Barran scolded them and told them that their behavior was shocking.“Poor form,” she called it. Boron kept muttering,“Don’t be too hard on them, dear. They’re just youngsters. Young males do that kind of thing.”“Boron, I would like to point out that Primrose and Gylfie are not males.”“Oh, but I still know a lot of wet poop jokes,” Primrose tooted up. The air was laced with the soft churr sounds that owls make when they laugh. They were all churring except for Barran. Boron was churring the hardest. His big white fluffy body was shaking so hard that he shook loose a few wisps of down.“Really! Boron! It’s not a laughing matter,” his mate said in dismay.“But it is, my dear.

It was all hushed up, though. But he’s made friends with werewolves and giants too. We think he’d do anything for a bit of power.” Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a Dark Art.

A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue“as worthy of investigation. Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with evildoers.” Similarly,“anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence.” Albus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the Triwizard Tournament.

His sister blinked.“Soren? Oh, Soren!” she cried as he swept her under his wings.“I ain’t done nothing, Mags, I swear. Nothing.” Bubbles was crying and sputtering in near hysterics.“I just held up this here piece of glass we got from that castle over in Am- bala and she done gone yoicks.”“Take me to the music, Soren. Take me to the music. Take us all to the music,” Eglantine cried. CHAPTER TWENTY- FIVE In the Folds of the Night Soren perched on a slender branch next to Eglantine. He draped one wing over her shoulders. It seemed like a miracle. His sister was back— really back. And now she said they must listen to the harp music. If she had told him to hang upside down and be mobbed by crows, he would have. He had never been happier in his life. The other owlets that had been rescued were now gathering on the limbs outside the concert hollow. Madame Plonk rarely allowed owls to observe harp practice but she made an exception now. Boron came and perched on the other side",Bubbles
Wormtail.”,4117,4164,True,756:the second man.?,"’s voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry.“You… are going… to kill me too?”“Wormtail, Wormtail,” said the cold voice silkily,“why would I kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless. In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays. Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns.…” Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh— an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.“We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail.” Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse— with amusement. He was dangerous— a madman. And he was planning more murders— this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was— was in danger— Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village… but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.“One more murder… my faithful servant at Hogwarts…",the second man

Professor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical eye was dancing in its socket.“Nice and easy does the trick, Potter,” he growled.“Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please…” said Professor McGonagall. Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking worried.“Dragons!” she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside. The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric’s shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry’s shoulder, talking furiously all the while.“Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next? You’re very lucky… this is quite shallow… it’ll need cleaning before I heal it up, though.…” She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.“Now, just sit quietly for a minute— sit! And then you can go and get your score.” She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say,“How does it feel now, Diggory?” Harry didn’t want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline. He got to his feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he’d reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside— Hermione, followed closely by Ron.“Harry, you were brilliant!” Hermione said squeakily. There were",Madam Pomfrey

I am not asking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful servant will have rejoined us—”“I am a faithful servant,” said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice.“Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.”“I found you,” said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now.“I was the one who found you. I brought you Bertha Jorkins.”“That is true,” said the second man, sounding amused.“A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail— though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were you?”“I— I thought she might be useful, My Lord—”“Liar,” said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever.“However, I do not deny that her information was invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform.…”“R- really, My Lord? What—?” Wormtail sounded terrified again.“Ah, Wormtail, you don’t want me to spoil the surprise? Your part will come at the very end… but I promise you, you will have the honor of being just",the second man
"“Move me closer to the fire,",2371,2381,True,175:Frank.M,"across the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, grasping his walking stick firmly. Several feet from the entrance, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond. The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised him. Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man’s voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.“There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still hungry.”“Later,” said a second voice. This too belonged to a man— but it was strangely high- pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank’s neck stand up.“Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.” Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head. Then he went out of sight again.“Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice.“I— I don’t know, My Lord,” said the first voice nervously.“She set out to explore the house, I think.…”“You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,”",Frank

Soren thought of his own face, covered in pure white feathers. This was the most distinctive feature of Barn Owls, and he really did not want to think of it growing singed and sooty. Maybe he was vain but he couldn’t help it.“Pay attention! Soren!” Elvan barked.“You nearly ran into Otulissa.” Thank Glaux she couldn’t speak, thought Soren. That was the only good thing about colliering. It was hard to speak with a live coal in one’s mouth. So Otulissa was effectively shut up for once.“All right, rest time. Drop your coals,” Elvan announced. Rest wasn’t really rest, however, as the ryb lectured them the entire time.“Tomorrow you shall begin flying with the coals in your beaks. It is not that different, really, from walking. Although you must take care to keep your coal alive and burning.”“Yeah!” Bubo boomed.“Dead coals ain’t going to do me a bit of good, young’uns. No sense flying in here with a great lot of ashes, cold as Glaux knows what.”“Yes,” continued Elvan.“We don’t want to disappoint Bubo.”“Oh, Glaux forbid that we should disappoint Bubo,” Otulissa mumbled. Soren stole a glance at her. There was pure venom in her eyes. Why couldn’t she just be angry about being in this chaw? What did Bubo have to do with it? Soren thought. He knew why, of course. Otulissa thought she was too good to have anything to do with Bubo. Neither Bubo nor any of the owls in this chaw had the distinguished background of",the ryb

Martin was supposed to not only collect cinders but report back on the larger coals that Soren and Otulissa were to retrieve. Soren hovered above with a careful eye on the little owl. He was getting used to the noise. Indeed, not only was he getting used to it but within the thunderous roar he could seek out smaller sounds, like the sound of Martin’s beating heart, which grew more rapid as he plunged. As Martin’s heartbeat quickened, Soren hoped with all his heart, gizzard, and soul that the little Saw- whet Owl would be all right. He could see now that Martin was on the ground.“Play your position, Otulissa,” Elvan rasped. Ruby had just caught another sparking coal.“But all the good ones go up there. We never get a chance.”“Shut your beak. You want to be sent back to the ridge? You’ll have your chance.” But Soren was not paying any attention to them. He must keep his focus on Martin, who was now just a little smudge on the ground. A cloud of smoke temporarily obscured him and Soren flew lower. There he was! There he was! Good heavens, he was coming up fast!“He’s coming in loaded!” Bubo slid in next to Elvan. And then he was there. Cinders poured from his small beak. His face was sooty and smudged but his eyes danced with a light as bright as the fire.“I did it! I did it!”“You certainly did, young’un.” Bubo flew up and tousled",Elvan

Soren had been joined by Twilight, Digger, and Gylfie at the edge of the nest. They waited and waited, then looked at one another.“Sir,” Gylfie began,“I think something might have happened to your mate… uh… er… She dove into the sea and no sign of her yet.”“Oh, she’ll be a while. Lot of mouths to feed.” It seemed like forever, but then they saw her break through the surface. Several small fish hung neatly from her beak.“There she is! There she is!” Gylfie said.“Good old Ma,” Dumpy sighed.“Hope she brought some capelin. I just love capelin. If you don’t like it, will you give me yours? Please, please, please?”“Sure,” Soren said. Every minute that he stayed in this smelly hollow he was getting less hungry.“Look at that,” Twilight said.“How’s she going to get off?” The others now crowded to the edge of the ice hollow. Down below, it appeared that the female was trying to run across the surface of the water while madly flapping her wings.“Water takeoff— not easy for any of us. We’re not the best fliers, but, as you can see, we can dive. Got these little air pockets so we can go really deep for a long, long time.

He’ll tell you what it’s like to fly with no ballast in your gizzard.”“I remember that time before I had acquired the taste for hair and thought I could go through that hurricane. Last time I ever tried that. Nearly got caught in the rim of the eye, I did. Now, you don’t want to do that, young’uns.” Poot was a Boreal Owl like Soren and Gylfie’s old friend Grimble.“What happens if you get caught in the rim of the eye of a hurricane?” asked Rudy.“Oh, you spin around till you’re dead. Just around and around and around. Awful nasty way to go. Usually get your wings torn off in the process,” said Poot.“Now, don’t go scaring them, Poot,” Octavia said and gave a ripple so that all their plates clattered a bit.“And please, young’uns, don’t try that trick of slipping the fur under the table. Remember, I am the table and it itches something fierce.” It was not even dark yet, but the weather chaw owls were already on the takeoff limb. It was all they could do to hang on as the gale lashed about them and the limb bucked in the turbulent wind. Shards of ice flew through the air.“We take off upwind, naturally.” Although Soren was not sure in this gale which way upwind even was.“We’re going to fly straight out over the Sea of Hoolemere.",Poot

His yell had awoken Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville. All of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings, heavy- eyed and tousle- haired.“Someone attacking you, Harry?” Seamus asked sleepily.“No, it’s just Dobby,” Harry muttered.“Go back to sleep.”“Nah… presents!” said Seamus, spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed. Ron, Dean, and Neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some present- opening too. Harry turned back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next to Harry’s bed, still looking worried that he had upset Harry. There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy.“Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present?” he squeaked tentatively.“’ Course you can,” said Harry.“Er… I’ve got something for you too.” It was a lie",Seamus

I can assure you that neither I nor anyone in my family is a cactus in bloom— whatever a cactus is and whatever a desert is.”“Well, what are you?” Mrs. Plithiver finally spoke up.“Well, what in the name of ice are you?” the creature retorted.“I’m a snake… a nest- maid snake.

Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open. It was hollow and completely empty— but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw.“Shut it!” Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again.“Sounded like a banshee.… Maybe you’ve got to get past one of those next, Harry!”“It was someone being tortured!” said Neville, who had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor.“You’re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse!”“Don’t be a prat, Neville, that’s illegal,” said George.“They wouldn’t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing… maybe you’ve got to attack him while he’s in the shower, Harry.”“Want a jam tart, Hermione?” said Fred.

Can’t we go?”“Nonsense. You know how we feel about make- believe.” The little owlet dipped his head in embarrassment.“It’s not make- believe,” said Gylfie.“Oh, you can’t be serious, young’un,” said the male.“It’s just a story, an old legend.”“Let me tell you something,” said the female, who Soren disliked more and more by the second.“It does not do any good to believe in things you can not see, touch, or feel. It is a waste of time. From the look of your flight feathers’ development, not to mention your talons, it is apparent that you are either fly- aways or orphans. Why else would you be out cavorting about the skies at such dangerous hours of the morning? I think your parents would be ashamed of you. I can tell you have good breeding.” She looked directly at Soren and blinked. Soren thought he might explode with anger. How did this owl know what his parents might think? How dare she suggest that she knew them so well that she knew they would be ashamed of him? And then there was a small soft, hissing voice.“I am ashamed of anyone who has eyes and still can not see.” It was Mrs. Plithiver. She slithered from the corner in the hollow.“But, of course, to see with two eyes is a very common thing.”“What is she talking about?” said the male.“What happened to the old days when servants served and were quiet?

I’m starving.” The Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn’t been present at one since his own. He was quite looking forward to it. Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.“Hiya, Harry!” It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s starting! My brother Dennis!”“Er— good,” said Harry.“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat.“I just hope he’s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?”“Er— yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick.“Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor.“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione.“Parvati Patil’s twin’s in Ravenclaw, and they’re identical. You’d think they’d be together, wouldn’t you?” Harry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be rather more empty seats there than usual.

Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge. Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn’t even got his letter? His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.“They need squeezing. You will collect the pus—”“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout,“and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork",Professor Sprout

In a very haughty voice she said,“You have not been tempered by battle yet. Nor do you know the first thing about strategy. You probably don’t even know how to fly with battle claws. I have been here much longer than you and still have not yet become a member of a chaw.”“What’s a chaw?” Soren said.“You are selected to join a chaw— a small team of owls— and you will learn a skill that is helpful.”“In battle?” Twilight asked.“Not just battle— in life.

The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably. A bunchy Barred Owl poked her head in.“Any tea here?”“Oh, yes, I think a cup of milkberry tea would be lovely.”“I dropped the egg. I don’t deserve to live.” Primrose emitted a long sound halfway between a whistle and a wail.“Don’t say that!” Soren exclaimed.“Of course you deserve to live. Every owl deserves to live. That’s why we came here.” Matron stopped what she was doing and cocked her head and regarded the young Barn Owl. Perhaps he was learning; just perhaps he was beginning to catch a glimmer of the true meaning of a noble deed. She would leave him to comfort this little Pygmy Owl and",the little owl

The thermal drafts came up like slabs of rock. Martin and Soren were sucked up at least twenty feet but as they passed the hill they felt a terrific coolness and they dropped another thirty feet. Soren realized that it was only cool compared to the heat they had just flown through. Bubo now circled back. He had been flying far out in front.“Good ember beds ahead. Perfect for all of you.” So this was it, Soren thought. This was when they became true colliers. Just then, like a shooting star, something red whizzed by.“Beautiful catch, Ruby,” shouted Poot.“What a natural that Short- eared Owl is!” Elvan gasped in amazement. Ruby began to wing off toward the coal buckets that Bubo had set up on the ridge. The small buckets made in his forge, with bits of kindling in the bottom already lit, would keep the coals hot.“All right, Martin going in!” Elvan called out the command. The little owl began a tight spiraling plunge to earth.“Cover him, Soren.” Soren would fly cover until Martin returned with a beakful of cinders. Elvan actually carried the very small cinder pot in his talons. Martin was supposed to not only collect cinders but report back on the larger coals that Soren and Otulissa were to retrieve.

Then, as he strode down a long, straight path, he saw movement once again, and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature, one which he had only seen in picture form, in his Monster Book of Monsters. It was a sphinx. It had the body of an over- large lion: great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman. She turned her long, almond- shaped eyes upon Harry as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress. Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.“You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.”“So… so will you move, please?” said Harry, knowing what the answer was going to be.“No,” she said, continuing to pace.“Not unless you can answer my riddle. Answer on your first guess— I let you pass. Answer wrongly— I attack. Remain silent— I will let you walk away from me unscathed.” Harry’s stomach slipped several notches. It was Hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he could keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative route to the center.“Okay,” he said.“Can I hear the riddle?” The sphinx sat down",a woman

You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.”“Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice.“She tried to curse hers off.”“Silly girl,” said Professor Sprout, shaking her head.“But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end.” A booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds, signaling the end of the lesson, and the class separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for Transfiguration, and the Gryffindors heading in the other direction, down the sloping lawn toward Hagrid’s small wooden cabin, which",Professor Sprout

Ron didn’t answer. He was glaring at Hermione and Krum, who were dancing nearby. Padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling in time to the music. Every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at Ron, who was completely ignoring her. Parvati sat down on Harry’s other side, crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from Beauxbatons.“You don’t mind, do you, Harry?” Parvati said.“What?” said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.“Oh never mind,” snapped Parvati, and she went off with the boy from Beauxbatons. When the song ended, she did not return. Hermione came over and sat down in Parvati’s empty chair. She was a bit pink in the face from dancing.“Hi,” said Harry. Ron didn’t say anything.“It’s hot, isn’t it?” said Hermione, fanning herself with her hand.“Viktor’s just gone to get some drinks.” Ron gave her a withering look.“Viktor?” he said.“Hasn’t he asked you to call him Vicky yet?” Hermione looked at him in surprise.“What’s",Parvati

The doctors did note(as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face— but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death? As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while. To everyone’s surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.“’S far as I’m concerned, he killed them, and I don’t care what the police say,” said Dot in the Hanged Man.“And if he had any decency, he’d leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.” But Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next— for neither family stayed long. Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair. The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for“tax reasons,” though nobody was very clear what these might be. The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however. Frank was nearing his seventy- seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could",Dot

His talons!” She paused.“Or lack of!” The Whiskered Screech, indeed, had only three talons on one foot. And just as Soren was blinking in a mixture of astonishment and horror, the old owl swung his head about and fixed Soren in his squinted gaze. Soren thought his gizzard was going to drop right out of him.“So, Elvanryb,” Boron turned and addressed another owl, a Great Gray.“It is your notion that we need to have a search- and- rescue attachment chaw on the colliering missions?”“Not all, Boron. I think they are only necessary when we are in areas near battle zones. So often the parents are off fighting. In normal circumstances, the parents are there if a fire breaks out, but tonight, for instance, we had to pick up that little Pygmy and a Northern Saw- whet. We got them back, but it taxed our chaw, believe me— carrying coals and injured owlets. Can’t exactly drop them in the coal bucket. And I don’t even like to think of the ones we might have missed and left behind.” The old Whiskered Screech raised his deformed foot.“Yes, Ezylryb?” Boron nodded to the owl.“Question for Bubo.” the Whiskered Screech’s voice was a low growl.“You think this fire was natural or more trouble with the rogue raids?”“No telling, sir. The rogues make good targets, and it wouldn’t be the first time raiding one caused a fire.”“Hmmm,” the Whiskered Screech replied, and then scratched his head with the second of the three remaining talons of one foot.“Next order of business,” Boron said.“Something about starvation in Ambala?” Ambala!

Climbing the baggywrinkles and then straight into the gutter. Follow us!” The baggywrinkles were the shredded air currents that lay between the scuppers and the gutter. A power thrust was required to get over them. Soren banked and followed the veteran owl, Poot. Martin was in between the two. The tiny owl would get a boost from Poot’s speed, as a vacuum would be created, through which he could be sucked up and over the baggywrinkles right into the gutter. Ruby was just ahead of him. She let escape a small joyous hoot. And then, suddenly, Soren knew why. Here, at the center of the gale, in the gutter, the winds all seemed to flow like one great turbulent river.

Dobby now handed Harry a small package, which turned out to be— socks.“Dobby is making them himself, sir!” the elf said happily.“He is buying the wool out of his wages, sir!” The left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the right sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.“They’re… they’re really… well, thanks, Dobby,” said Harry, and he pulled them on, causing Dobby’s eyes to leak with happiness again.“Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas dinner in the kitchens!” said Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving good- bye to Ron and the others as he passed.

This was the most distinctive feature of Barn Owls, and he really did not want to think of it growing singed and sooty. Maybe he was vain but he couldn’t help it.“Pay attention! Soren!” Elvan barked.“You nearly ran into Otulissa.” Thank Glaux she couldn’t speak, thought Soren. That was the only good thing about colliering. It was hard to speak with a live coal in one’s mouth. So Otulissa was effectively shut up for once.“All right, rest time. Drop your coals,” Elvan announced. Rest wasn’t really rest, however, as the ryb lectured them the entire time.“Tomorrow you shall begin flying with the coals in your beaks. It is not that different, really, from walking.

The creature, whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in its hands. Yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar.…“Dobby?” said Harry incredulously. The tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn’t Dobby— it was, however, unmistakably a house- elf, as Harry’s friend Dobby had been. Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family.“Did sir just call me Dobby?” squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby’s had been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected— though it was very hard to tell with a house- elf— that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.“Sorry,” Harry told the elf,“I just thought you were someone I knew.”“But I knows Dobby too, sir!” squeaked the elf.

She led them past the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses were standing, huddled against the cold, and toward a tree on the edge of the forest, where a large and beautiful unicorn was tethered. Many of the girls“ooooohed!” at the sight of the unicorn.“Oh it’s so beautiful!” whispered Lavender Brown.“How did she get it? They’re supposed to be really hard to catch!” The unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look gray. It was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its horned head.“Boys keep back!” barked Professor Grubbly- Plank, throwing out an arm and catching Harry hard in the chest.“They prefer the woman’s touch, unicorns. Girls to the front, and approach with care, come on, easy does it.…” She and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn, leaving the boys standing near the paddock fence, watching.

Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron, and Hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast- Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn’t suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn’t seem to have mouths.“Ouch!” yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes.“It got me!

You know how we feel about make- believe.” The little owlet dipped his head in embarrassment.“It’s not make- believe,” said Gylfie.“Oh, you can’t be serious, young’un,” said the male.“It’s just a story, an old legend.”“Let me tell you something,” said the female, who Soren disliked more and more by the second.“It does not do any good to believe in things you can not see, touch, or feel.

How dare she suggest that she knew them so well that she knew they would be ashamed of him? And then there was a small soft, hissing voice.“I am ashamed of anyone who has eyes and still can not see.” It was Mrs. Plithiver. She slithered from the corner in the hollow.“But, of course, to see with two eyes is a very common thing.”“What is she talking about?” said the male.“What happened to the old days when servants served and were quiet?

Glistening with wetness, it appeared shimmering, almost fiery as the setting sun turned its ice into liquid flames of pink, then orange and red.“Dumpy,” his father called.“Come over here, son. I want you to step up here and watch the young’uns fly. They are the masters of silent flight. Never going to hear a wing flap with these owls!” Just before they took off, Soren looked at each of the owls. He wasn’t the only one who had dreamed of the Mirror Lakes. They all wanted to go back. Could it be that wrong if they all wanted to do it? Twilight slid in close to him.“Soren, the three of us have been thinking.”“Yes?”“Thinking about The Beaks and the Mirror Lakes. We’ve been thinking, why not go back there for just a little while? You know, just to kind of rest up, get this fish out of our system.

Twilight cocked his head.“It seems that for some the fog lifts, the blizzards stop, and the mist blows away.”“For some?” asked Gylfie.“For those who believe.” Swatums paused and then sniffed in disdain.“But do they say what?

There is more to life than just battles. Each chaw has its own, oh, how should I put it? Personality. Navigation chaw tends to have a kind of elegance, they are all superb flyers, as are the members of search- and- rescue, but they, of course, are less refined. Weather interpretation and colliering are decidely rough and uncouth.

Would he be up to it? He had to be. With his friends, he could. Look what they had accomplished so far!“Do we all get to be in the same chaw?” Soren asked.“Probably not.”“But we’re a band.” Soren hoped that he did not sound as if he were pleading.“That doesn’t matter now. You’re part of a larger band. I have to go.”“Duty calls, I suppose,” Gylfie said with a slight edge in her voice.",the Spotted Owl
"“But Dobby talks of you all the time,",32181,32193,True,1327:the elf.F,"this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.“Sorry,” Harry told the elf,“I just thought you were someone I knew.”“But I knows Dobby too, sir!” squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit.“My name is Winky, sir— and you, sir—” Her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon Harry’s scar.“You is surely Harry Potter!”“Yeah, I am,” said Harry.“But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!” she said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck.“How is he?” said Harry.“How’s freedom suiting him?”“Ah, sir,” said Winky, shaking her head,“ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free.”“Why?” said Harry, taken aback.“What’s wrong with him?”“Freedom is going to Dobby’s head, sir,” said Winky sadly.“Ideas above his station, sir. Can’t get another position, sir.”“Why not?” said Harry. Winky lowered her voice by a half- octave and whispered,“He is wanting paying for",the elf
"But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard,",4117,4164,True,756:the second man.?,"’s voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry.“You… are going… to kill me too?”“Wormtail, Wormtail,” said the cold voice silkily,“why would I kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless. In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays. Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns.…” Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh— an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.“We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail.” Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse— with amusement. He was dangerous— a madman. And he was planning more murders— this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was— was in danger— Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village… but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.“One more murder… my faithful servant at Hogwarts…",the second man
"“Pus,",64179,64186,True,366:Professor Sprout.F,"feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge. Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn’t even got his letter? His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.“They need squeezing. You will collect the pus—”“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout,“and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus.

Anyway, where’s the fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get’ round Dumbledore? Fancy entering?”“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked Harry.“Be cool to enter, wouldn’t it? But I s’pose they might want someone older.… Dunno if we’ve learned enough.…”“I definitely haven’t,” came Neville’s gloomy voice from behind Fred and George.“I expect my gran’d want me to try, though. She’s always going on about how I should be upholding the family honor. I’ll just have to— oops.…” Neville’s foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase. There were many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts; it was second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step, but Neville’s memory was notoriously poor. Harry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.“Shut it, you,” said Ron, banging down its visor as they passed. They made their way up to the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, which was concealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dress.“Password?” she said as they approached.“Balderdash,” said George,“a prefect downstairs told me.",Neville

Harry Potter?”“Er— yeah,” said Harry. Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable.“Ced’s talked about you, of course,” said Amos Diggory.“Told us all about playing against you last year.… I said to him, I said— Ced, that’ll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will.… You beat Harry Potter!” Harry couldn’t think of any reply to this, so he remained silent. Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered.“I told you… it was an accident.…”“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back.“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman… but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh?

If Cedric had been outside the time limit, he most certainly had been.“Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration, which was nevertheless effective, and was second to return with his hostage. We award him forty points.” Karkaroff clapped particularly hard, looking very superior.“Harry Potter used gillyweed to great effect,” Bagman continued.“He returned last, and well outside the time limit of an hour. However, the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety, not merely his own.” Ron and Hermione both gave Harry half- exasperated, half- commiserating looks.“Most of the judges,” and here, Bagman gave Karkaroff a very nasty look,“feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks.

There she is!” Gylfie said.“Good old Ma,” Dumpy sighed.“Hope she brought some capelin. I just love capelin. If you don’t like it, will you give me yours? Please, please, please?”“Sure,” Soren said. Every minute that he stayed in this smelly hollow he was getting less hungry.“Look at that,” Twilight said.“How’s she going to get off?” The others now crowded to the edge of the ice hollow. Down below, it appeared that the female was trying to run across the surface of the water while madly flapping her wings.“Water takeoff— not easy for any of us. We’re not the best fliers, but, as you can see, we can dive. Got these little air pockets so we can go really deep for a long, long time. Getting back to the nest is the hardest part for us.” The male stepped out of the ice hollow and called down.“Dearest, try that patch over there under the lee, the water is smoother.” She gave her mate a withering glance, and somehow through the mouthful of fish yelled back,“You want me to fly directly into the wall, Puff Head! There’s a tailwind. I’ll slam beak- first into it. Then where will your dinner be? If you’re so smart you come down and go fishing yourself.”“Oh, sorry, dear, silly me.” Then he turned to the owls.“We’re really not that bright.

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson’s gang of Slytherin girls. All of them were looking at something Harry couldn’t see and sniggering heartily. Pansy’s pug- like face peered excitedly around Goyle’s broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached.“There they are, there they are!” she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands— Witch Weekly. The moving picture on the front showed a curly- haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.“You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!” Pansy said loudly, and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking startled. At that moment, the dungeon door opened, and Snape beckoned them all inside. Hermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual. Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of today’s potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk. At last, in the center pages, Hermione found what they were looking for. Harry and Ron leaned in closer.

And Soren himself had a funny feeling in his gizzard. Gylfie suddenly turned to him.“I think they’re worried about Ezylryb.” Soren blinked.“Maybe tomorrow we should go out and take a look.” Twilight and Digger alighted at that moment next to them on the branch.“Take a look?” Digger asked.“A look for what?”“Ezylryb,” Twilight said.“I heard them talking, too.” There was a sudden pulsing of light in the sky and then a gasp from all the owls as a radiance swept the black night.“What is it? What is it?”“Oh, great Glaux, we are blessed!” hooted Barran.“It is the Aurora Glaucora,” Boron sang out. Soren, Gylfie, Digger, Twilight, and Eglantine all looked at one another. They had no idea what Barran and Boron were talking about. But the sky seemed rinsed with colors, colors that streamed like banners through the night. Suddenly, Madame Plonk abandoned her perch by the harp and flew out into the brilliance of the night. Still singing, she swept through the long lances of light, her white body reflecting the colors. It was irresistible. Soren remembered that morning months ago when he and Madame Plonk had flown through the rainbow. But the rainbow was pale next to these pulsing banners of light that draped the sky. His worries about Ezylryb grew dimmer as the colors grew brighter. The",Barran

What would he ever have to say to such a beautiful and elegant owl? Flying was one thing, but sitting and talking was another. Soren saw dozens of rosy- scaled blind snakes crawling up to the hollow where the harp was kept. Soon the Great Ga’Hoole Tree would begin to awake and stir to the lovely harmonies of Evensong.

When we went for our tour of the guilds, I knew immediately that the harp was for me. As I slipped through the strings from one note to another, climbing the scales, leaping octaves, the vibrations never left me. And the very best part was to try to— oh, how shall I explain— weave the music into Madame Plonk’s voice. So that together the sound of the harp and the sound of Madame Plonk’s voice made something so large and splendid.” Soren blinked. Mrs. P., he thought, had something much better than a gizzard.“Must be off myself,” the other nest snake said cheerily.“I’m just going around to drop in on Octavia, bring her a few well- seasoned milkberries. She does love them so and, as you know, she does keep the nest for Madame Plonk. Never can hurt, can it? Ta- ta!” And she slithered out of the hollow. Soren wedged himself into a corner where he wouldn’t be seen. But he heard Mrs. P. muttering after the other snake was out of earshot.“To presume to have a gizzard and then go slithering off to Octavia, humming tunes and besieging her with milkberries. Well, I never!” Soren decided to skip visiting Mrs. P. He knew what he must do. He must“drop by” Madame Plonk’s, and he must tell her that here was a very special snake, a snake that had something even finer than a gizzard, a snake of the highest— what was that word Mrs. P. was always using?—“Sensibilities, artistic sensibilities.” CHAPTER NINETEEN A Visit to Madame Plonk You see, Madame Plonk, I know that perhaps",the other nest snake

They almost forgot to breathe in their anguish. There was indeed a tiny speckle in the darker feathers on the inside corner of her eye. But if this was Eglantine, was she alive? Was she dead? Was she truly…?“Eglantine?” they both called softly. CHAPTER TWENTY- THREE At Last! I need some more worms over here, quick!” the nest- maid snake called out.“The Ga’Hoolology chaw is digging them as fast as they can,” another snake called.“Oh, my goodness, what a mess this little Sooty Owl is.” The snake nudged the last worm of her supply on the gash in the Sooty’s wing.“Poor little fellow. Now stop that babbling, dear. You don’t have enough energy.” But the owlet kept up a steady singsong about a world of Tyto purity and supremacy. There had never been such a flurry in the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. The infirmary was brimming with stunned and wounded owls. And no one was spared a moment’s rest. The owls of the tree were cutting back and forth between branches, flying in the new arrivals, rushing about getting fresh worms for their wounds, plucking down from their own breasts to make up new beds, bringing cup after cup of milkberry tea.

And look at those sparks from the tail just below the moon. Great Glaux, even the moon is beginning to look red.” Digger’s voice was quavery with worry.“I told you about Octavia.

She says everyone there is very superstitious, but I don’t know, I guess she just thinks the owls here will laugh at her or something. I’m not sure.” Suddenly, Soren was experiencing a tight, uncomfortable feeling as he flew. He had never felt uncomfortable flying, even when he was diving into the fringes of forest fires to gather coals on colliering missions.

He lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since. There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.“Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn’t.”“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar,“he had a hard war, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to—”“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked the cook.“There’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember!

The Spotted Owl blinked again.“I mean, we’re in the right place, aren’t we?

An uncertain feeling that was not quite a doubt, yet not a real belief, began to stir in Soren’s gizzard.“This is the place?” his voice quavered.“Of course it’s the place,” the Spotted Owl replied.“Then get us some battle claws— we’re ready!” Twilight stomped one talon impatiently.“You’re ready!” Otulissa gasped.“You think just because you escaped and killed two rattlebrained owls, you’re ready?”“And the bobcat,” Soren said.“And the crows,” Digger piped up.“Well",The Spotted Owl

Soren stole a glance at her. There was pure venom in her eyes. Why couldn’t she just be angry about being in this chaw? What did Bubo have to do with it? Soren thought. He knew why, of course. Otulissa thought she was too good to have anything to do with Bubo. Neither Bubo nor any of the owls in this chaw had the distinguished background of Otulissa. It was an outrage, as she told Soren forty times a night, that she had not been included in Strix Struma’s navigation chaw. Elvan continued speaking during their break.“And then, of course, after you have had enough nights of weather training we shall find a nice forest fire for you— nothing too big, mind you.

Once you start a fire going, wouldn’t there always be new coals?” This was some smart little owl, Soren thought. Why hadn’t the others thought of this question? Why were new coals from a new fire needed?

The air spun with colored light from the whirlyglasses that hung from the ceiling and sometimes jutted out from the walls, suspended on twigs jammed into cracks. There were several openings through which light poured. There were pieces of cloth embroidered with beautiful designs and one little niche spilled over with strands of luminous beads. Indeed, the hollow seemed to swirl with color. And in the middle of all this color there was a dazzling whiteness— Madame Plonk. Soren gulped and tried to keep his eyes from straying from that whiteness.“But I just know that Mrs. P. is rather shy and would never dare.”“Mrs. P.?” Madame Plonk broke in.“I don’t believe I know this snake.”“She came with me, ma’am. She’s my family’s old nest- maid snake.”“Oh, and you were saying that she wants to be in the harp guild?”“Yes, ma’am.” Soren thought he sounded so stupid. Who cares? he thought.

He chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling.“Very well, very well,” Snape snapped.“Potter, leave your things here, I want you back down here later to test your antidote.”“Please, sir— he’s got to take his things with him,” squeaked Colin.“All the champions—”“Very well!” said Snape.“Potter— take your bag and get out of my sight!” Harry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for the door.

Now, you don’t want to do that, young’uns.” Poot was a Boreal Owl like Soren and Gylfie’s old friend Grimble.“What happens if you get caught in the rim of the eye of a hurricane?” asked Rudy.“Oh, you spin around till you’re dead. Just around and around and around. Awful nasty way to go. Usually get your wings torn off in the process,” said Poot.“Now, don’t go scaring them, Poot,” Octavia said and gave a ripple so that all their plates clattered a bit.“And please, young’uns, don’t try that trick of slipping the fur under the table. Remember, I am the table and it itches something fierce.” It was not even dark yet, but the weather chaw owls were already on the takeoff limb. It was all they could do to hang on as the gale lashed about them and the limb bucked in the turbulent wind. Shards of ice flew through the air.“We take off upwind, naturally.” Although Soren was not sure in this gale which way upwind even was.“We’re going to fly straight out over the Sea of Hoolemere. Try to find the main part of the gale.” Ezylryb spoke in short snappish sentences.“Now listen up. Here’s what you need to know about a gale, or any storm, really— except for hurricanes— they be a little different with their eyes and all. But what you got in a gale",Octavia

Hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him inside. He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high- ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing,“Harry Potter, sir! Harry Potter!” Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.“D- Dobby?” Harry gasped.“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel.“Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!” Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis- ball- shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil- shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and feet— all except the clothes, which were very different. When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards",the squealing elf

This was the most distinctive feature of Barn Owls, and he really did not want to think of it growing singed and sooty. Maybe he was vain but he couldn’t help it.“Pay attention! Soren!” Elvan barked.“You nearly ran into Otulissa.” Thank Glaux she couldn’t speak, thought Soren. That was the only good thing about colliering. It was hard to speak with a live coal in one’s mouth. So Otulissa was effectively shut up for once.“All right, rest time. Drop your coals,” Elvan announced. Rest wasn’t really rest, however, as the ryb lectured them the entire time.“Tomorrow you shall begin flying with the coals in your beaks. It is not that different, really, from walking. Although you must take care to keep your coal alive and burning.”“Yeah!” Bubo boomed.“Dead coals ain’t going to do me a bit of good, young’uns. No sense flying in here with a great lot of ashes, cold as Glaux knows what.”“Yes,” continued Elvan.“We don’t want to disappoint Bubo.”“Oh, Glaux forbid that we should disappoint Bubo,” Otulissa mumbled. Soren stole a glance at her. There was pure venom in her eyes. Why couldn’t she just be angry about being in this chaw? What did Bubo have to do with it? Soren thought. He knew why, of course. Otulissa thought she was too good to have anything to do with Bubo. Neither Bubo nor any of the owls in this chaw had the distinguished background of",the ryb

I might be able to help.”“You?” Twilight asked somewhat incredulously.“Remember, dear, how Digger had been asking me to ride on his back in the desert? This might just be the time.” A few seconds later they were coming in on Digger’s upwind wing.“Digger,” Soren said,“we know you’re hurt.”“I don’t know if I can make it,” the Burrowing Owl groaned.“Oh, if I could only walk.”“There’s a stand of trees really close,” Soren said.“Mrs. P. has an idea that might help you.”“What’s that?”“She’s going to get on your good wing. That will tip your injured wing up again, lighten the drag on it. Gylfie meanwhile will fly under your bad wing and create a little updraft for it. It might work.”“I don’t know,” Digger moaned miserably.“Faith, boy! Faith!” exhorted Mrs. Plithiver.“Now let’s get on with it.”“I really don’t think I can make it,” Digger gasped.“You can, boy!

Yet as they drew closer to the opposite shore, the air did seem different. And although Soren, like other owls, did not have the keenest sense of smell, the air seemed tinged with an acrid odor. They landed on the ridge of some high cliffs. Ezylryb was already pointing with his three- taloned foot to some clouds just beyond the ridge.“We call them Ga’Hoole clouds. You know why?” Otulissa’s talon shot up.“Because they are the shape of the seeds found in the Ga’Hoole fruits.”“Right- o, missy,” Ezylryb said. Martin gave a little sigh.“She never stops, does she?” It was clear that Martin was very nervous. More nervous than the others. Soren felt bad for him. He was the smallest owl in the chaw. It had to be scary.“Don’t worry, Martin. You’re going to be all right.”“Soren, that’s kind of you, but do you realize that I am the first Saw- whet to ever be in the colliering chaw?”“They must think you’re special, Martin,” Soren said.“But what if I’m not?” Martin said, a squeak of desperation creeping into his voice.

The man with the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse— with amusement. He was dangerous— a madman. And he was planning more murders— this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was— was in danger— Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village… but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.“One more murder… my faithful servant at Hogwarts… Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will be no more argument. But quiet… I think I hear Nagini.…” And the second man’s voice changed. He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure. And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright. Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer and closer— What was he to do?

Can’t we go?”“Nonsense. You know how we feel about make- believe.” The little owlet dipped his head in embarrassment.“It’s not make- believe,” said Gylfie.“Oh, you can’t be serious, young’un,” said the male.“It’s just a story, an old legend.”“Let me tell you something,” said the female, who Soren disliked more and more by the second.“It does not do any good to believe in things you can not see, touch, or feel. It is a waste of time. From the look of your flight feathers’ development, not to mention your talons, it is apparent that you are either fly- aways or orphans. Why else would you be out cavorting about the skies at such dangerous hours of the morning? I think your parents would be ashamed of you. I can tell you have good breeding.” She looked directly at Soren and blinked. Soren thought he might explode with anger. How did this owl know what his parents might think? How dare she suggest that she knew them so well that she knew they would be ashamed of him? And then there was a small soft, hissing voice.“I am ashamed of anyone who has eyes and still can not see.” It was Mrs. Plithiver. She slithered from the corner in the hollow.“But, of course, to see with two eyes is a very common thing.”“What is she talking about?” said the male.“What happened to the old days when servants served and were quiet?

When we went for our tour of the guilds, I knew immediately that the harp was for me. As I slipped through the strings from one note to another, climbing the scales, leaping octaves, the vibrations never left me. And the very best part was to try to— oh, how shall I explain— weave the music into Madame Plonk’s voice. So that together the sound of the harp and the sound of Madame Plonk’s voice made something so large and splendid.” Soren blinked. Mrs. P., he thought, had something much better than a gizzard.“Must be off myself,” the other nest snake said cheerily.“I’m just going around to drop in on Octavia, bring her a few well- seasoned milkberries. She does love them so and, as you know, she does keep the nest for Madame Plonk. Never can hurt, can it? Ta- ta!” And she slithered out of the hollow. Soren wedged himself into a corner where he wouldn’t be seen. But he heard Mrs. P. muttering after the other snake was out of earshot.“To presume to have a gizzard and then go slithering off to Octavia, humming tunes and besieging her with milkberries. Well, I never!” Soren decided to skip visiting Mrs. P. He knew what he must do. He must“drop by” Madame Plonk’s, and he must tell her that here was a very special snake, a snake that had something even finer than a gizzard, a snake of the highest— what was that word Mrs. P. was always using?—“Sensibilities, artistic sensibilities.” CHAPTER NINETEEN A Visit to Madame Plonk You see, Madame Plonk, I know that perhaps",the other nest snake

Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered.“I told you… it was an accident.…”“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back.“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman… but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh?

The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably.

I don’t deserve to live.” Primrose emitted a long sound halfway between a whistle and a wail.“Don’t say that!” Soren exclaimed.“Of course you deserve to live. Every owl deserves to live. That’s why we came here.” Matron stopped what she was doing and cocked her head and regarded the young Barn Owl. Perhaps he was learning; just perhaps he was beginning to catch a glimmer of the true meaning of a noble deed. She would leave him to comfort this little Pygmy Owl and",the little owl

A sleeve of Ron’s dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious. Ron made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy was too quick for him; he seized the sleeve and pulled.“Look at this!” said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron’s robes and showing Crabbe and Goyle,“Weasley, you weren’t thinking of wearing these, were you?

There’s money involved as well, you know… you’d be able to afford some decent robes if you won.…”“What are you talking about?” snapped Ron.“Are you going to enter?” Malfoy repeated.“I suppose you will, Potter?

As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus.

Hagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound, Fang. There were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his collar, apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely.

There is nothing that noble about slaughtering two bad owls in the desert.” The Spotted Owl rose up to her full height and looked down her beak at Gylfie.

He certainly didn’t want the owls of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree to think he came from such a murderous family. Kludd was the only one, after all.“I was snatched by a St. Aggie’s patrol. It was at St. Aggie’s that I met Gylfie.” It was difficult at first to speak and not look at Ezylryb’s mangled foot, but as he spoke, Soren became more relaxed. The owls seemed attentive but not particularly impressed, not even when he told them about Hortense and that it was not simply starvation that was accounting for the low egg counts in Ambala.“And so?” Barran said when Soren appeared to have concluded.“And so what?” Soren asked.“What is it you want, dear?”“The four of us are a band. We have flown together, fought together, and escaped many dangers— as a band. We know from our experience that there is great evil that threatens every owl in every owl kingdom on earth. We want only to fight this evil, to become guardian knights of this order.” He saw Ezylryb stifle a yawn and pick up what appeared to be a dried caterpillar to munch.“We feel that we have special knowledge. We have much to offer,” Soren concluded.“I am sure you do,” said Boron.“Every owl here has special knowledge and, during your training, you will find out what your talents are.

Really, Bill, what do they say at the bank?”“Mum, no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure,” said Bill patiently.“And your hair’s getting silly, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, fingering her wand lovingly.“I wish you’d let me give it a trim.…”“I like it,” said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill.“You’re so old- fashioned, Mum. Anyway, it’s nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore’s.…” Next to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were all talking spiritedly about the World Cup.“It’s got to be Ireland,” said Charlie thickly, through a mouthful of potato.“They flattened Peru in the semifinals.”“Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though,” said Fred.“Krum’s one decent player, Ireland has got seven,” said Charlie shortly.“I wish England had got through. That was embarrassing, that was.”“What happened?” said Harry eagerly, regretting more than ever his isolation from the wizarding world when he was stuck on Privet Drive.“Went down to Transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten,” said Charlie gloomily.“Shocking performance.

“Where you come from?”,14427,14433,True,325:the female.F,"“Duh!” said one of the little ones.“Gee, Pop, I’m feeling smarter all the time.”“But if you’re puffins,” Gylfie continued,“we must be in the North.”“Ta- da!” said one of the puffins.“Gee, you owls are getting smarter every minute!”“Does she get a prize, Mummy, for answering the question right?” Another little chick, with an immense beak almost as long as it was tall, poked its head out of the hole.“Oh, we’re just having fun with them, Dumpy.”“But how did we get so far north?” Soren asked.“Must have gotten blown off course,” said the female.“Where you come from?”“The Beaks,” Twilight said.“Where you headed?”“The island in the Sea of Hoolemere.”“Great Ice! You’ve passed it by. Overshot it by five hundred leagues.”“What! We flew over it and didn’t even see it?” Digger said, his voice barely audible.“Where are we exactly?” Gylfie asked.“You’re in the Ice Narrows, far side of Hoolemere, edge of the Northern Kingdoms.”“What!” All four owls gasped.“Don’t feel too dumb,” the male said.“Bad weather conditions.”“When do we ever have good ones, dear?” his mate mused.“Well, true.

What would he ever have to say to such a beautiful and elegant owl? Flying was one thing, but sitting and talking was another. Soren saw dozens of rosy- scaled blind snakes crawling up to the hollow where the harp was kept. Soon the Great Ga’Hoole Tree would begin to awake and stir to the lovely harmonies of Evensong. For twilight was upon them. CHAPTER THIRTEEN Books of the Yonder Now, young ones, please follow me as we explore the wondrous root structure of our dear tree.

A perfect example.”“Here’s one,” Gylfie mimicked Otulissa.“She has the most annoying voice.”“Now if we can find a pellet or if someone would care to yarp one, I shall demonstrate the proper burying technique. Pellets properly buried nourish the tree,” the ryb continued.“Oh, I’ll find you one,” Otulissa quickly volunteered and bustled off.“This is the most borrring class,” sighed Soren. They had been stomping around the base of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree all during twilight.“I don’t think it’s that bad,” said Digger.

You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.”“Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice.“She tried to curse hers off.”“Silly girl,” said Professor Sprout, shaking her head.“But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end.” A booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds, signaling the end of the lesson, and the class separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for Transfiguration, and the Gryffindors heading in the other direction, down the sloping lawn toward Hagrid’s small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.

"Who’s just been chosen as school champion,",93386,93405,True,2112:the Fat Lady.F,"… Yet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar hurting, Voldemort had not been alone… he had been talking to Wormtail… plotting Harry’s murder.… Harry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady already. He had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady,“Violet’s just told me everything. Who’s just been chosen as school champion, then?”“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly.“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room. The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred; he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed.“How did you do it without getting a beard?

I’m starving.” The Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn’t been present at one since his own. He was quite looking forward to it. Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.“Hiya, Harry!” It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.“Harry, guess what?

“The ice is melting.,16171,16189,True,565:the male puffin.M,"they supposed to be going instead? Soren kept forgetting. All he could remember were the rolls of warm wind to play on, the still, glasslike lake, the everlasting summer. No ice, no blizzard. Why not live there happily ever after? The dream tugged on him. In his sleep, he felt his gizzard turn and something begin to dim, while the longing for The Beaks and the Mirror Lakes grew stronger and stronger.“Time to get up, young’uns.” It was the male puffin, nudging Soren with one of his large, orange, webbed feet.“Wind died down. You can fly out of here now. The wall’s weeping.”“Huh?” Soren asked.“What do you mean the wall’s weeping?”“The ice is melting. Means warm air, the thermals have come. Easy flying.” The other owls were already up and standing at the rim of the hollow. The wall certainly was weeping. Glistening with wetness, it appeared shimmering, almost fiery as the setting sun turned its ice into liquid flames of pink, then orange and red.“Dumpy,” his father called.“Come over here, son. I want you to step up here and watch the young’uns fly. They are the masters of silent flight. Never going to hear a wing flap with these owls!” Just before they took off, Soren looked at each of the owls. He wasn’t the only one who had dreamed of the Mirror Lakes. They all wanted to go back.

Half an hour later, each of them had been given a complicated circular chart, and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth. It was dull work, requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles.“I’ve got two Neptunes here,” said Harry after a while, frowning down at his piece of parchment,“that can’t be right, can it?”“Aaaaah,” said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney’s mystical whisper,“when two Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, Harry…” Seamus and Dean, who were working nearby, sniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from Lavender Brown—“Oh Professor, look! I think I’ve got an unaspected planet! Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?”“It is Uranus, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, peering down at the chart.“Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?” said Ron. Most unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him, and it was this, perhaps, that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class.“A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you, with reference to your personal chart,” she snapped, sounding much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy- fairy self.“I want it ready to hand in next Monday, and no excuses!”“Miserable old bat,” said Ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner.“",Lavender Brown

He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high- ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing,“Harry Potter, sir! Harry Potter!” Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.“D- Dobby?” Harry gasped.“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel.“Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!” Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis- ball- shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil- shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and feet— all except the clothes, which were very different. When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World Cup.

If Cedric had been outside the time limit, he most certainly had been.“Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration, which was nevertheless effective, and was second to return with his hostage. We award him forty points.” Karkaroff clapped particularly hard, looking very superior.“Harry Potter used gillyweed to great effect,” Bagman continued.“He returned last, and well outside the time limit of an hour. However, the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety, not merely his own.” Ron and Hermione both gave Harry half- exasperated, half- commiserating looks.“Most of the judges,” and here, Bagman gave Karkaroff a very nasty look,“feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks.

Soren stole a glance at her. There was pure venom in her eyes. Why couldn’t she just be angry about being in this chaw? What did Bubo have to do with it? Soren thought. He knew why, of course. Otulissa thought she was too good to have anything to do with Bubo. Neither Bubo nor any of the owls in this chaw had the distinguished background of Otulissa. It was an outrage, as she told Soren forty times a night, that she had not been included in Strix Struma’s navigation chaw. Elvan continued speaking during their break.“And then, of course, after you have had enough nights of weather training we shall find a nice forest fire for you— nothing too big, mind you.

Not too many ridges or mountains to complicate wind patterns.”“Pardon me,” piped up the little Northern Saw- whet Owl, Martin, who had been rescued the same night as Primrose.“Yes, Martin,” Elvan said.“Well, I don’t understand why we need new coals all the time. Once you start a fire going, wouldn’t there always be new coals?” This was some smart little owl, Soren thought. Why hadn’t the others thought of this question? Why were new coals from a new fire needed?

Just don’t stand around, come in and make yourself useful,” Matron called. Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes.

See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably.

Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable.“Ced’s talked about you, of course,” said Amos Diggory.“Told us all about playing against you last year.… I said to him, I said— Ced, that’ll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will.… You beat Harry Potter!” Harry couldn’t think of any reply to this, so he remained silent.

There was indeed a tiny speckle in the darker feathers on the inside corner of her eye. But if this was Eglantine, was she alive? Was she dead? Was she truly…?“Eglantine?” they both called softly. CHAPTER TWENTY- THREE At Last! I need some more worms over here, quick!” the nest- maid snake called out.“The Ga’Hoolology chaw is digging them as fast as they can,” another snake called.“Oh, my goodness, what a mess this little Sooty Owl is.” The snake nudged the last worm of her supply on the gash in the Sooty’s wing.“Poor little fellow. Now stop that babbling, dear. You don’t have enough energy.” But the owlet kept up a steady singsong about a world of Tyto purity and supremacy. There had never been such a flurry in the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. The infirmary was brimming with stunned and wounded owls. And no one was spared a moment’s rest. The owls of the tree were cutting back and forth between branches, flying in the new arrivals, rushing about getting fresh worms for their wounds, plucking down from their own breasts to make up new beds, bringing cup after cup of milkberry tea. The nest- maid snakes were at the point of complete exhaustion and even Madame Plonk, who rarely lifted a talon around the tree to do anything, could not bear seeing her harp guild so worn out.

"They will be obsessed with security,",2737,2804,True,175:Frank.M,"My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?”“A week,” said the cold voice.“Perhaps longer. The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan can not proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.” Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word“Quidditch,” which was not a word at all.“The— the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said Wormtail.(Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.)“Forgive me, but— I do not understand— why should we wait until the World Cup is over?”“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, checking and double- checking identities. They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait.” Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words“Ministry of Magic,”“wizards,” and“Muggles.” Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of menace in the cold voice now. A slight pause followed— and then Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.“It could be",Frank

Why?“Oh!” said Cho, and she went red too.“Oh Harry, I’m really sorry,” and she truly looked it.“I’ve already said I’ll go with someone else.”“Oh,” said Harry. It was odd; a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes, but suddenly he didn’t seem to have any insides at all.“Oh okay,” he said,“no problem.”“I’m really sorry,” she said again.“That’s okay,” said Harry. They stood there looking at each other, and then Cho said,“Well—”“Yeah,” said Harry.“Well,’ bye,” said Cho, still very red. She walked away.

It felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence. Completely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to Gryffindor Tower, Cho’s voice echoing in his ears with every step he took.“Cedric— Cedric Diggory.” He had been starting to quite like Cedric— prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at Quidditch, and was handsome, and popular",Cho

They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait.” Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words“Ministry of Magic,”“wizards,” and“Muggles.” Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of menace in the cold voice now. A slight pause followed— and then Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.“It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord.” Another pause, more protracted, and then—“Without Harry Potter?” breathed",Frank

They almost forgot to breathe in their anguish. There was indeed a tiny speckle in the darker feathers on the inside corner of her eye. But if this was Eglantine, was she alive? Was she dead? Was she truly…?“Eglantine?” they both called softly. CHAPTER TWENTY- THREE At Last! I need some more worms over here, quick!” the nest- maid snake called out.“The Ga’Hoolology chaw is digging them as fast as they can,” another snake called.“Oh, my goodness, what a mess this little Sooty Owl is.” The snake nudged the last worm of her supply on the gash in the Sooty’s wing.“Poor little fellow. Now stop that babbling, dear. You don’t have enough energy.” But the owlet kept up a steady singsong about a world of Tyto purity and supremacy. There had never been such a flurry in the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. The infirmary was brimming with stunned and wounded owls. And no one was spared a moment’s rest. The owls of the tree were cutting back and forth between branches, flying in the new arrivals, rushing about getting fresh worms for their wounds, plucking down from their own breasts to make up new beds, bringing cup after cup of milkberry tea. The nest- maid snakes were at the point of complete exhaustion and even",The two owls

Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn’t believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he’d gotten through the first task, and he wouldn’t have to face the second one for three months.“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands.“Open it, Harry, go on! Let’s just see what’s inside it!”“He’s supposed to work out the clue on his own,” Hermione said swiftly.“It’s in the tournament rules.…”“I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too,” Harry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather guiltily.“Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!” several people echoed. Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open. It was hollow and completely empty— but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room.

Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry could hear two voices arguing, coming closer and closer.“— that’s blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that—”“— we’ve tried being polite; it’s time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn’t like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did—”“I’m telling you, if you put that in writing, it’s blackmail!”“Yeah, and you won’t be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will you?” The Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.“What’re you doing here?” Ron and Fred said at the same time.“Sending a letter,” said Harry and George in unison.“What, at this time?” said Hermione and Fred. Fred grinned.“Fine— we won’t ask you what you’re doing, if you don’t ask us,” he said. He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands.

Down below, it appeared that the female was trying to run across the surface of the water while madly flapping her wings.“Water takeoff— not easy for any of us. We’re not the best fliers, but, as you can see, we can dive. Got these little air pockets so we can go really deep for a long, long time. Getting back to the nest is the hardest part for us.” The male stepped out of the ice hollow and called down.“Dearest, try that patch over there under the lee, the water is smoother.” She gave her mate a withering glance, and somehow through the mouthful of fish yelled back,“You want me to fly directly into the wall, Puff Head! There’s a tailwind. I’ll slam beak- first into it. Then where will your dinner be? If you’re so smart you come down and go fishing yourself.”“Oh, sorry, dear, silly me.” Then he turned to the owls.“We’re really not that bright. I mean we dive well, know how to fish, and deal with ice, but that’s about it.” But, in fact, the puffins knew more and were not that dumb at all.“Just low self- esteem,” Gylfie said. The puffins, in addition to knowing how to dive and fish, knew weather. And just now they were telling them that there would be a small pocket of time when the wind would turn, and they could leave before the next storm came in.“You see, young’uns,” said the male puffin,“nine days out often, the wind slams full force up",the female

I find it makes for rather temperamental wands… however, to each his own, and if this suits you…” Mr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for scratches or bumps; then he muttered,“Orchideous!” and a bunch of flowers burst from the wand tip.“Very well, very well, it’s in fine working order,” said Mr. Ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing them to Fleur with her wand.“Mr. Diggory, you next.” Fleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he passed her.“Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn’t it?” said Mr. Ollivander, with much more enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand.“Yes, I remember it well.

You bust slug!”,26787,26796,True,907:his mother.F,"; he had never really thought much about those in other countries. Their fellow campers were starting to wake up. First to stir were the families with small children; Harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before. A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid- shaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent.“How many times, Kevin? You don’t— touch— Daddy’s— wand— yecchh!” She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy’s yells—“You bust slug! You bust slug!” A short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older than Kevin, who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls’ toes to skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron, and Hermione he muttered distractedly,“In broad daylight! Parents having a lie- in, I suppose—” Here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast. Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces, as though sure this couldn’t work.

After half an hour or so, Hermione, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried herself once more in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a Summoning Charm. Neville listened jealously to the others’ conversation as they relived the Cup match.“Gran didn’t want to go,” he said miserably.“Wouldn’t buy tickets. It sounded amazing though.”“It was,” said Ron.“Look at this, Neville.…” He rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature figure of Viktor Krum.“Oh wow,” said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum onto his pudgy hand.“We saw him right up close, as well,” said Ron.“We were in the Top Box—”“For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.” Draco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway. Behind him stood Crabbe and Goyle, his enormous, thuggish cronies, both of whom appeared to have grown at least a foot during the summer. Evidently they had overheard the conversation through the compartment door, which Dean and Seamus had left ajar.“Don’t remember asking you to join us, Malfoy,” said Harry coolly.“Weasley… what is that?” said Malfoy, pointing at Pigwidgeon’s cage.

There is nothing that noble about slaughtering two bad owls in the desert.” The Spotted Owl rose up to her full height and looked down her beak at Gylfie. In a very haughty voice she said,“You have not been tempered by battle yet. Nor do you know the first thing about strategy. You probably don’t even know how to fly with battle claws. I have been here much longer than you and still have not yet become a member of a chaw.”“What’s a chaw?” Soren said.“You are selected to join a chaw— a small team of owls— and you will learn a skill that is helpful.”“In battle?” Twilight asked.“Not just battle— in life. There is more to life than just battles. Each chaw has its own, oh, how should I put it? Personality. Navigation chaw tends to have a kind of elegance, they are all superb flyers, as are the members of search- and- rescue, but they, of course, are less refined. Weather interpretation and colliering are decidely rough and uncouth. But,” and the Spotted Owl fixed a very intense gaze on Twilight,“they are all fiercely brave and can fight or fly to the death!” Twilight seemed to swell in anticipation, but Soren almost shrank with fear. Would he be up to it? He had to be. With his friends, he could. Look what they had accomplished so far!“Do we all get to be in the same chaw?” Soren asked.“Probably not.”“But we’re a band.” Soren hoped that he did not sound as if he were pleading.“That doesn’t matter now. You’re part of a larger band. I have to go.”“Duty calls, I suppose,” Gylfie said with a slight edge in her voice.",the Spotted Owl

His surly face darkened as he surveyed Harry. Cedric looked nonplussed. He looked from Bagman to Harry and back again as though sure he must have misheard what Bagman had said. Fleur Delacour, however, tossed her hair, smiling, and said,“Oh, vairy funny joke, Meester Bagman.”“Joke?” Bagman repeated, bewildered.“No, no, not at all!

Fleur frowned.“But evidently zair’ as been a mistake,” she said contemptuously to Bagman.“’ E can not compete.’ E is too young.”“Well… it is amazing,” said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at Harry.“But, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure. And as his name’s come out of the goblet… I mean, I don’t think there can be any ducking out at this stage.… It’s down in the rules, you’re obliged… Harry will just have to do the best he—” The door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came in: Professor Dumbledore, followed closely by Mr. Crouch, Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Snape",Fleur

You eat fish?”“Not much else. Better get used to it.”“And I’m going fishing before that storm comes,” the female said. As she waddled toward the nest opening, Soren began to appreciate how truly preposterous this bird was. It was not only her face, with its large bulbous orange beak and the dark eyes ringed in red and set in slightly skewed ovals of white feathers, but also her body was the strangest shape. Chubby, with not one slim or graceful line and, with her chest thrust out, she appeared as if she might topple forward at any second. How this thing flew was a mystery. Indeed, now, tottering on the edge of the nest, it appeared as if she hesitated to take off, but finally she did by windmilling her wings awkwardly until, at last, she seemed to organize them for a direct plunge into the sea.

Now, when the champions’ names are called, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk along the staff table, and go through into the next chamber”— he indicated the door behind the staff table—“where they will be receiving their first instructions.” He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at once, all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging them into a state of semidarkness. The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey- whiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes. Everyone watched, waiting.… A few people kept checking their watches.…“Any second,” Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away from Harry. The flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again. Sparks began to fly from it. Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it— the whole room gasped.

I think we got ourselves a G- flat!” CHAPTER TWENTY Fire! Ezylryb perched on a limb at the very top of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree and squinted into the blueness of the early summer day. He had been perched here for the last two days almost continuously with Poot by his side. They were studying the cloud behavior on the far side of Hoole- mere.“Bring the chaw up,” he ordered tersely.“There’s enough for them to observe.”“What!

Quick- o!” What could it be? Soren thought. Poot only called Ezylryb“Cap” when they were on a flight mission. But there wasn’t any bad weather. It was a calm, perfectly clear day. It was the time of the golden rain, when the strands of Ga’Hoole berries that hung from the limbs turned a rich yellow. By the time Soren got to the top limb, the others had assembled— albeit sleepily. Martin was yawning into the morning sun, but Otulissa was alert and full of questions and already peppering the air with her observations of cloud formations. Ruby yarped her morning pellet and looked to Soren as if she was so",Poot
"“Interesting lesson,",71845,71871,True,349:Neville.M,"just like that!” They were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as though it had been some sort of spectacular show, but he hadn’t found it very entertaining— and nor, it seemed, had Hermione.“Hurry up,” she said tensely to Harry and Ron.“Not the ruddy library again?” said Ron.“No,” said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage.“Neville.” Neville was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wide- eyed look he had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.“Neville?” Hermione said gently. Neville looked around.“Oh hello,” he said, his voice much higher than usual.“Interesting lesson, wasn’t it? I wonder what’s for dinner, I’m— I’m starving, aren’t you?”“Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.“Oh yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice.“Very interesting dinner— I mean lesson— what’s for eating?” Ron gave Harry a startled look.“Neville, what—?” But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard.“It’s all right, sonny,” he said to Neville.“Why don’t you come up to my office?

They landed on the ridge of some high cliffs. Ezylryb was already pointing with his three- taloned foot to some clouds just beyond the ridge.“We call them Ga’Hoole clouds. You know why?” Otulissa’s talon shot up.“Because they are the shape of the seeds found in the Ga’Hoole fruits.”“Right- o, missy,” Ezylryb said. Martin gave a little sigh.“She never stops, does she?” It was clear that Martin was very nervous. More nervous than the others. Soren felt bad for him. He was the smallest owl in the chaw. It had to be scary.“Don’t worry, Martin. You’re going to be all right.”“Soren, that’s kind of you, but do you realize that I am the first Saw- whet to ever be in the colliering chaw?”“They must think you’re special, Martin,” Soren said.“But what if I’m not?” Martin said, a squeak of desperation creeping into his voice. Ezylryb continued speaking about the Ga’Hoole clouds.“The reason their tops are curved like that is because— well, you tell me.” Once again, Otulissa’s talon shot up.“It’s simple weather physics.

He had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady,“Violet’s just told me everything. Who’s just been chosen as school champion, then?”“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly.“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room. The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.“You should’ve told us you’d entered!",the Fat Lady

I can’t imagine what it does to the air. I mean, flying through it must be almost impossible. You could never even half guess where the dead falls might be.”“Technically, the fire does that”—Otulissa had caught up with them—“because the fire climbs what is called, according to the literature, a fuel ladder.”“Yes, and think of me,” Martin now spoke.“I am on the ground, supposedly looking for the smallest embers. One of these crowning things happens, and at my weight I get sucked straight up the fuel ladder.”“We all have to spend time on the ground, not just you,” Soren said.“It could happen to any of us. You don’t have to be little.” Martin cocked his head and blinked. He did not look convinced. Although they had yet to be in an actual forest fire, each member of the chaw had a type of coal or ember they were in charge of gathering. Ruby, being the best flier, would seek airborne embers that were dispersed to the highest parts of the thermal draft columns. Soren and Otulissa were assigned a midpoint position on various sides of the convection column and little Martin was on the ground. But, indeed, they would all have to do a certain amount of groundwork. Soren could not help but think",Martin
"“Yes,",21180,21209,True,175:Matron.?,"what will Mum and Da think?” For a moment Soren’s gizzard gave a lurch. Could this little owl be Eglantine?“They will think that you were a brave little Pygmy Owl,” Matron replied. Soren sighed.“What are you doing out there? Just don’t stand around, come in and make yourself useful,” Matron called. Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably.

Harry sighed.“Can’t you think of anyone who’d go with Ron?” he said, lowering his voice so that Ron wouldn’t hear.“What about Hermione Granger?” said Parvati.“She’s going with someone else.” Parvati looked astonished.“Ooooh— who?” she said keenly.

I AM something in this old owl’s eyes. I am almost as smart as Otulissa, and Ezylryb believes in me! It was now time to move to a ridge closer to the fire. The chaw lifted into the air, each owl flying close to its buddy. They were not halfway to the next ridge when they saw the thick smoke, almost white in the night, rolling up, and then the tongues of flame dancing against the night. Ezylryb began a steeply banking turn. The others followed. Bubo and Poot arrived shortly with fresh voles and mice in their talons, some still squirming.“Eat light, eat all the hair!” Ezylryb barked.“I wonder why he always calls it hair?” Martin said quietly.“They say he comes from a distant place called the land of the Great North Waters and they have odd ways of speaking,” Ruby said.“But hair? What’s hair?” Martin persisted.“Well, there’s fur and there’s feathers— I think it’s something in between,” Ruby said.“Do you want me to ask Otulissa?”“No!” Soren and Martin both groaned. Less than an hour had passed when Bubo flew down from his higher perch.“Prepare to fly.” The owls stood on the thin granite lip of the ridge, their talons hooked over the edge. They spread their wings, and Bubo gave the command.“FIRE!” They lifted off— first Bubo and",Martin
young ones.,19211,19229,True,172:Barran.F,"there are many skills you shall be able to learn here in the Great Ga’Hoole Tree, and we are all here to teach you. These shall be your rybs.” With those words, Boron swept his wings toward the walls of the hollow. There were ledges that hung like galleries above. Soren, Twilight, Gylfie, and Digger gasped as they saw a great gathering of owls— all kinds of owls from Burrowing ones to Barn Owls, from Pygmy Owls to Elf Owls, from Screech Owls to Sooty Owls, from Great Horned Owls to Snowy Owls. Every kind of owl imaginable was here within the hollow of the great tree, their yellow, black, and amber eyes blinking and winking in the most friendly and inquisitive manner at the five new arrivals. Barran continued,“Welcome, young ones. Welcome to the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. One journey has ended…” Just one? thought Soren. But just then a series of deep, rolling gongs began to shake the entire tree. Barran stopped mid- speech.“Chaws— back up to your positions!” This hoot came from a Great Gray Owl in the gallery. Then, it seemed as if the entire hollow suddenly brightened as owls began donning battle claws and helmets, and the flames of the candles flickered off the bright polished surfaces of the armored owls.“Great Glaux— a battle! Quick, let’s get our claws!” Twilight began to hop up and down, pumping his wings.“Not so fast, young’un.” A plump, Short- eared Owl waddled up to them.“But where’s the battle?” Twilight said.“Beyond the",Barran

I brought you Bertha Jorkins.”“That is true,” said the second man, sounding amused.“A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail— though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were you?”“I— I thought she might be useful, My Lord—”“Liar,” said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever.“However, I do not deny that her information was invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail.

And just as Soren was blinking in a mixture of astonishment and horror, the old owl swung his head about and fixed Soren in his squinted gaze. Soren thought his gizzard was going to drop right out of him.“So, Elvanryb,” Boron turned and addressed another owl, a Great Gray.“It is your notion that we need to have a search- and- rescue attachment chaw on the colliering missions?”“Not all, Boron. I think they are only necessary when we are in areas near battle zones. So often the parents are off fighting. In normal circumstances, the parents are there if a fire breaks out, but tonight, for instance, we had to pick up that little Pygmy and a Northern Saw- whet. We got them back, but it taxed our chaw, believe me— carrying coals and injured owlets. Can’t exactly drop them in the coal bucket. And I don’t even like to think of the ones we might have missed and left behind.” The old Whiskered Screech raised his deformed foot.“Yes, Ezylryb?” Boron nodded to the owl.“Question for Bubo.” the Whiskered Screech’s voice was a low growl.“You think this fire was natural or more trouble with the rogue raids?”“No telling, sir. The rogues make good targets, and it wouldn’t be the first time raiding one caused a fire.”“Hmmm,” the Whiskered Screech replied, and then scratched his head with the second of the three remaining talons of one foot.“Next order of business,” Boron said.“Something about starvation in Ambala?” Ambala!

It gives you a lot of control and you can ride the waves,” Ezylryb called back. Finally, Otulissa arrived, sputtering with rage and talking about a report that she was going to make about“this outrageous activity.”“Oh, shut your beak!” Poot screeched at her.

Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw table, where everyone was applauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down. For a fleeting second, Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.“Baddock, Malcolm!”“SLYTHERIN!” The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins.

Several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed, including Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom, a round- faced, extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a grandmother. Seamus was still wearing his Ireland rosette. Some of its magic seemed to be wearing off now; it was still squeaking“Troy— Mullet— Moran!” but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way. After half an hour or so, Hermione, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried herself once more in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a Summoning Charm. Neville listened jealously to the others’ conversation as they relived the Cup match.“Gran didn’t want to go,” he said miserably.“Wouldn’t buy tickets. It sounded amazing though.”“It was,” said Ron.“Look at this, Neville.…” He rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature figure of Viktor Krum.“Oh wow,” said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum onto his pudgy hand.“We saw him right up close, as well,” said Ron.“We were in the Top Box—”“For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.” Draco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway.

The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren asked.“A fire— forest fire. I didn’t think it would reach our tree and when it did, well, I tried to save one of the eggs. But you know, I haven’t been flying that long and, well, I just…” Here, she began to sob uncontrollably. A bunchy Barred Owl poked her head in.“Any tea here?”“Oh, yes, I think a cup of milkberry tea would be lovely.”“I dropped the egg. I don’t deserve to live.” Primrose emitted a long sound halfway between a whistle and a wail.“Don’t say that!” Soren exclaimed.“Of course you deserve to live. Every owl deserves to live. That’s why we came here.” Matron stopped what she was doing and cocked her head and regarded the young Barn Owl.

They went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts, to find Neville there alone, sitting on his bed, reading. He looked a good deal calmer than at the end of Moody’s lesson, though still not entirely normal. His eyes were rather red.“You all right, Neville?” Harry asked him.“Oh yes,” said Neville,“I’m fine, thanks. Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me.…” He held up the book: Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean.“Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I’m really good at Herbology,” Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely heard there before.“He thought I’d like this.” Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything. It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done. Harry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to the common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the coming month.

Before he could finish the potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep. Harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn’t open his eyes, wanting to drop off again. The room was still dimly lit; he was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he couldn’t have been asleep very long.

After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon. They said good- bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door. A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents.

Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.“They need squeezing. You will collect the pus—”“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout,“and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus.

But he heard Mrs. P. muttering after the other snake was out of earshot.“To presume to have a gizzard and then go slithering off to Octavia, humming tunes and besieging her with milkberries. Well, I never!” Soren decided to skip visiting Mrs. P. He knew what he must do. He must“drop by” Madame Plonk’s, and he must tell her that here was a very special snake, a snake that had something even finer than a gizzard, a snake of the highest— what was that word Mrs. P. was always using?—“Sensibilities, artistic sensibilities.” CHAPTER NINETEEN A Visit to Madame Plonk You see, Madame Plonk, I know that perhaps this is not proper— me coming to you this way.” Soren could hardly keep his mind on what he was saying, as he had never in his life seen a hollow like this one. The air spun with colored light from the whirlyglasses that hung from the ceiling and sometimes jutted out from the walls, suspended on twigs jammed into cracks. There were several openings through which light poured. There were pieces of cloth embroidered with beautiful designs and one little niche spilled over with strands of luminous beads. Indeed, the hollow seemed to swirl with color. And in the middle of all this color there was a dazzling whiteness— Madame Plonk. Soren gulped and tried to keep his eyes from straying from that whiteness.“But I just know that Mrs. P. is rather shy and would never dare.”“Mrs. P.?” Madame Plonk broke in.“I don’t believe I know this snake.”“She came with me, ma’am. She’s my family’s old nest- maid snake.”“Oh, and you were saying that she wants to be in the harp guild?”“Yes, ma’am.” Soren thought he sounded so stupid. Who cares? he thought. He was here for Mrs. P. She wanted this so much. Then it was as if Madame Plonk nearly took his next thought directly out of his head.“But wanting is one thing. One can not merely",ME

Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.“Sorry,” Harry told the elf,“I just thought you were someone I knew.”“But I knows Dobby too, sir!” squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit.“My name is Winky, sir— and you, sir—” Her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon Harry’s scar.“You is surely Harry Potter!”“Yeah, I am,” said Harry.“But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!” she said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck.“How is he?” said Harry.“How’s freedom suiting him?”“Ah, sir,” said Winky, shaking her head,“ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free.”“Why?” said Harry, taken aback.“What’s wrong with him?”“Freedom is going to Dobby’s head,",the elf

By forcing them to sleep during the full shines of the moon, directly exposing their heads to the moon’s light, they destroyed the will, the very personalities of individual owls and made them perfectly obedient with no thoughts of their own. Soren and Gylfie had devised a plan for fooling the sleep monitors and escaping the full shine. It turned out so had Hortense. She, in fact, was an infiltrator and had been sneaking out the eggs that St. Aggie’s patrols had been snatching. Unfortunately, however, she was caught and killed. Still, they had heard that Hortense had become a legend in Ambala because of her heroic deeds.“Yes,” another owl was speaking now.“The egg production is down, and it is thought to be caused by a blight on the rodent population. Simply not enough food.” Soren and Gylfie exchanged looks. It was not just the rodent population. It was the St. Aggie’s egg snatchers. This was information they could offer. This might convince Boron and Barran that they really knew something.“We’ll look into it,” Boron said.“And now, I believe some of our new arrivals have requested to speak with us.” He turned and blinked at the four young owls.

Harry was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly- Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.“I hope she stays, that woman!” said Parvati Patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch.“That’s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like… proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters.…”“What about Hagrid?” Harry said angrily as they went up the steps.“What about him?” said Parvati in a hard voice.“He can still be gamekeeper, can’t he?” Parvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good time all the same. She was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the next weekend trip.“That was a really good lesson,” said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall.“I didn’t know half the things Professor Grubbly- Plank told us about uni—”“Look at this!” Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily Prophet article under Hermione’s nose.

Was she truly…?“Eglantine?” they both called softly. CHAPTER TWENTY- THREE At Last!

Now stop that babbling, dear. You don’t have enough energy.” But the owlet kept up a steady singsong about a world of Tyto purity and supremacy. There had never been such a flurry in the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. The infirmary was brimming with stunned and wounded owls. And no one was spared a moment’s rest. The owls of the tree were cutting back and forth between branches, flying in the new arrivals, rushing about getting fresh worms for their wounds, plucking down from their own breasts to make up new beds, bringing cup after cup of milkberry tea.

From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people— Slytherins, mainly— quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering comments.“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?”“Since when have you been one of the top students in the school, Potter?

There were not many rules at the Great Ga’Hoole Tree but, as Matron instructed the young owls, there were to be no wet poop jokes anywhere, and especially not in the dining hollow. Therefore, the nest snakes were under orders, if it was teatime and they were serving, to immediately dismiss the culprits, and this was accomplished in just the manner Mrs. P. had done when she shook herself. They were ordered to go see Boron and Barran. As could be expected, Barran scolded them and told them that their behavior was shocking.“Poor form,” she called it. Boron kept muttering,“Don’t be too hard on them, dear. They’re just youngsters. Young males do that kind of thing.”“Boron, I would like to point out that Primrose and Gylfie are not males.”“Oh, but I still know a lot of wet poop jokes,” Primrose tooted up. The air was laced with the soft churr sounds that owls make when they laugh. They were all churring except for Barran. Boron was churring the hardest. His big white fluffy body was shaking so hard that he shook loose a few wisps of down.“Really! Boron! It’s not a laughing matter,” his mate said in dismay.“But it is, my dear. That’s the point.” And he began to laugh even harder. The owls had already settled down for the day. It had been several hours since Madame Plonk had sung her lovely“Night Is Done” song and all had wished one another good light until the next night.",Barran

I want you to step up here and watch the young’uns fly. They are the masters of silent flight. Never going to hear a wing flap with these owls!” Just before they took off, Soren looked at each of the owls. He wasn’t the only one who had dreamed of the Mirror Lakes. They all wanted to go back. Could it be that wrong if they all wanted to do it? Twilight slid in close to him.“Soren, the three of us have been thinking.”“Yes?”“Thinking about The Beaks and the Mirror Lakes. We’ve been thinking, why not go back there for just a little while? You know, just to kind of rest up, get this fish out of our system.

A sea that is always wrapped in fog, an island feathered in blizzards, and a tree veiled in mist.”“So,” said Twilight,“it’s not really invisible, it’s just bad weather.”“Not exactly,” replied Swatums. Twilight cocked his head.“It seems that for some the fog lifts, the blizzards stop, and the mist blows away.”“For some?” asked Gylfie.“For those who believe.” Swatums paused and then sniffed in disdain.“But do they say what? Believe in what? No. You see, that is the problem. Owls with fancy ideas— ridiculous! That’s how you get into trouble. Sweetums and I don’t believe in fancy ideas.

He remembered thinking this before when he was in the woods of The Beaks. He did notice, however, that Elvan’s fringe of light feathers below his beak seemed to be a permanently sooty gray. Soren thought of his own face, covered in pure white feathers. This was the most distinctive feature of Barn Owls, and he really did not want to think of it growing singed and sooty. Maybe he was vain but he couldn’t help it.“Pay attention! Soren!” Elvan barked.“You nearly ran into Otulissa.” Thank Glaux she couldn’t speak, thought Soren. That was the only good thing about colliering. It was hard to speak with a live coal in one’s mouth. So Otulissa was effectively shut up for once.“All right, rest time.

The Weird Sisters stopped playing, applause filled the hall once more, and Harry let go of Parvati at once.“Let’s sit down, shall we?”“Oh— but— this is a really good one!” Parvati said as the Weird Sisters struck up a new song, which was much faster.“No, I don’t like it,” Harry lied, and he led her away from the dance floor, past Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table where Ron and Padma were sitting.“How’s it going?” Harry asked Ron, sitting down and opening a bottle of",Parvati

Then, with a wave of his wand, all the tables zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear, and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall. A set of drums, several guitars, a lute, a cello, and some bagpipes were set upon it. The Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause; they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn. They picked up their instruments, and Harry, who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming, suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out, and that the other champions and their partners were standing up.“Come on!” Parvati hissed.“We’re supposed to dance!” Harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up. The Weird Sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune; Harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone’s eye(he could see Seamus and Dean waving at him and sniggering), and next moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed one around her waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers. It wasn’t as bad as it could have been, Harry thought, revolving slowly on the spot(Parvati was steering). He kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people, and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor, so that the champions were no longer the center of attention",Parvati

Like most, this hollow had both an inside and an outside entrance so that one could either fly in or walk in from one of the many inner pathways through the trunk of the tree. He peeked in. He saw the Short- eared Owl called Matron who had led them to their own hollow. She was bustling about, plucking down from her own breast and tucking it in around an owl.“Now, now, dear, we know you did your best.”“But what will Mum and Da think?” For a moment Soren’s gizzard gave a lurch. Could this little owl be Eglantine?“They will think that you were a brave little Pygmy Owl,” Matron replied. Soren sighed.“What are you doing out there? Just don’t stand around, come in and make yourself useful,” Matron called. Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes. Primrose here lost her nest.”“The whole tree,” gulped the little owl.“Yes, indeed. See, her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes, and they had left her all safe and sound.”“I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs. Mum was really only off hunting, not fighting. She was going to be right back.”“What happened?” Soren",Matron

Harry was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly- Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.“I hope she stays, that woman!” said Parvati Patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch.“That’s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like… proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters.…”“What about Hagrid?” Harry said angrily as they went up the steps.“What about him?” said Parvati in a hard voice.“He can still be gamekeeper, can’t he?” Parvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good time all the same. She was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the next weekend trip.“That was a really good lesson,” said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall.“I didn’t know half the things Professor Grubbly- Plank told us about uni—”“Look at this!” Harry snarled",Parvati

Hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him inside. He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high- ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing,“Harry Potter, sir! Harry Potter!” Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.“D- Dobby?” Harry gasped.“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel.“Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!” Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis- ball- shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil- shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and feet— all except the clothes, which were very different. When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards",the squealing elf

The Beauxbatons carriage was about to take off.“We will see each uzzer again, I’ ope,” said Fleur as she reached him, holding out her hand.“I am’ oping to get a job’ ere, to improve my Eenglish.”“It’s very good already,” said Ron in a strangled sort of voice.

It had the body of an over- large lion: great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman. She turned her long, almond- shaped eyes upon Harry as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress. Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.“You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.”“So… so will you move, please?” said Harry, knowing what the answer was going to be.“No,” she said, continuing to pace.“Not unless you can answer my riddle. Answer on your first guess— I let you pass. Answer wrongly— I attack. Remain silent— I will let you walk away from me unscathed.” Harry’s stomach slipped several notches. It was Hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he could keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative route to the center.“Okay,” he said.“Can I hear the riddle?” The sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of the path, and recited:“First think of the person who lives in disguise, Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.

Every minute that he stayed in this smelly hollow he was getting less hungry.“Look at that,” Twilight said.“How’s she going to get off?” The others now crowded to the edge of the ice hollow. Down below, it appeared that the female was trying to run across the surface of the water while madly flapping her wings.“Water takeoff— not easy for any of us. We’re not the best fliers, but, as you can see, we can dive. Got these little air pockets so we can go really deep for a long, long time. Getting back to the nest is the hardest part for us.” The male stepped out of the ice hollow and called down.“Dearest, try that patch over there under the lee, the water is smoother.” She gave her mate a withering glance, and somehow through the mouthful of fish yelled back,“You want me to fly directly into the wall, Puff Head! There’s a tailwind. I’ll slam beak- first into it. Then where will your dinner be? If you’re so smart you come down and go fishing yourself.”“Oh, sorry, dear, silly me.” Then he turned to the owls.“We’re really not that bright.

There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven o’clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom of her picture.“Lairy fights, that’s the one!” she giggled when they gave the password, and she swung forward to let them inside. Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very self- conscious, but none as much as Ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face. There was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly well; at least he was now lace- free, although he hadn’t done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs",the Fat Lady

Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn’t even got his letter? His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.“They need squeezing. You will collect the pus—”“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout,“and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish- green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork.“An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus.

Then the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.“I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you, and I will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few more months will make no difference. As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will be effective.

The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric’s shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry’s shoulder, talking furiously all the while.“Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next? You’re very lucky… this is quite shallow… it’ll need cleaning before I heal it up, though.…” She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.“Now, just sit quietly for a minute— sit! And then you can go and get your score.” She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say,“How does it feel now, Diggory?” Harry didn’t want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline.

After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon. They said good- bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door. A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents.

There was indeed a tiny speckle in the darker feathers on the inside corner of her eye. But if this was Eglantine, was she alive? Was she dead? Was she truly…?“Eglantine?” they both called softly. CHAPTER TWENTY- THREE At Last! I need some more worms over here, quick!” the nest- maid snake called out.“The Ga’Hoolology chaw is digging them as fast as they can,” another snake called.“Oh, my goodness, what a mess this little Sooty Owl is.” The snake nudged the last worm of her supply on the gash in the Sooty’s wing.“Poor little fellow. Now stop that babbling, dear. You don’t have enough energy.” But the owlet kept up a steady singsong about a world of Tyto purity and supremacy. There had never been such a flurry in the Great Ga’Hoole Tree. The infirmary was brimming with stunned and wounded owls. And no one was spared a moment’s rest. The owls of the tree were cutting back and forth between branches, flying in the new arrivals, rushing about getting fresh worms for their wounds, plucking down from their own breasts to make up new beds, bringing cup after cup of milkberry tea. The nest- maid snakes were at the point of complete exhaustion and even Madame Plonk, who rarely lifted a talon around the tree to do anything, could not bear seeing her harp guild so worn out. So she joined in right beside them, learning how to place",The two owls

If you’re so smart you come down and go fishing yourself.”“Oh, sorry, dear, silly me.” Then he turned to the owls.“We’re really not that bright. I mean we dive well, know how to fish, and deal with ice, but that’s about it.” But, in fact, the puffins knew more and were not that dumb at all.“Just low self- esteem,” Gylfie said. The puffins, in addition to knowing how to dive and fish, knew weather. And just now they were telling them that there would be a small pocket of time when the wind would turn, and they could leave before the next storm came in.“You see, young’uns,” said the male puffin,“nine days out often, the wind slams full force up these Ice Narrows. That’s how you got sucked into here in the first place. But on the tenth day, it can turn around and suck you right back out. Nice high stream coming through that could pull you right back to The Beaks, if you want to go that far.” He paused and each of the owls stole a glance at one another. The Beaks sounded lovely. This place was so harsh and cold and there was the terrible stench of the fish and the awful oiliness that seemed to make their gizzards greasy. How could they help but think of the Mirror Lakes, where it was always summer and the voles were fat and the flying spectacular? They would",the male puffin

The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan can not proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.” Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word“Quidditch,” which was not a word at all.“The— the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said Wormtail.(Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.)“Forgive me, but— I do not understand— why should we wait until the World Cup is over?”“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, checking and double- checking identities.

He had distinctly heard the words“Ministry of Magic,”“wizards,” and“Muggles.” Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of menace in the cold voice now. A slight pause followed— and then Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.“It could be",Frank

Within the depths of the impenetrable white, Twilight saw two even whiter patches.“Come, young’uns. You’re right over the current. Can’t tell it on a night like this, though. So, welcome to the Island of Hoole.” Two giant Snowy Owls had melted out from the night and they were so white that by comparison the mist seemed gray.“I am Boron and this is my mate, Barran.”“You are the king and the queen of Hoole.” Twilight whispered. Digger and Gylfie, exhausted, plummeted down near them.“Yes, my dears. But we prefer to be called teachers, or rybs. The word ryb means teacher and deep knowledge,” said Barran.“We’re not keen on titles,” chuckled Boron.“But you came out to meet us?” said Soren.“Of course,” replied Boron.“You’ve done the hard part. Now let us guide you the rest of the way. It’s not far.” The blizzard had been swallowed by the mist and the mist now seemed to melt away against the whiteness of Boron and Barran. The night turned black again and the stars broke out. As a half moon rose, the four young owls looked below and saw the vast sea glinting with silver spangles from the moonlight and then, directly ahead, spreading into the night, were the twisting branches of the largest tree they had ever seen, the Great Ga’Hoole Tree.“",Barran

Harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs.“Er,” he said. He couldn’t ask her. He couldn’t. But he had to. Cho stood there looking puzzled, watching him. The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them.“Wangoballwime?”“Sorry?” said Cho.“D’you— d’you want to go to the ball with me?” said Harry. Why did he have to go red now? Why?“Oh!” said Cho, and she went red too.“Oh Harry, I’m really sorry,” and she truly looked it.“I’ve already said I’ll go with someone else.”“Oh,” said Harry. It was odd; a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes, but suddenly he didn’t seem to have any insides at all.“Oh okay,” he said,“no problem.”“I’m really sorry,” she said again.“That’s okay,” said Harry. They stood there looking at each other, and then Cho said,“Well—”“Yeah,” said Harry.“Well,’ bye,” said Cho, still very red. She walked away.

Not too many ridges or mountains to complicate wind patterns.”“Pardon me,” piped up the little Northern Saw- whet Owl, Martin, who had been rescued the same night as Primrose.“Yes, Martin,” Elvan said.“Well, I don’t understand why we need new coals all the time. Once you start a fire going, wouldn’t there always be new coals?” This was some smart little owl, Soren thought. Why hadn’t the others thought of this question? Why were new coals from a new fire needed? Elvan turned to Bubo.“Bubo, as chief smith, would you care to answer that?”“Sure thing, mate.” Then he stepped up to Martin and, towering over him, began to speak.“A very good question. You are right, it is very possible to keep fires going forever and that is fine for some things— things like cooking and warming up a hollow. But for certain tasks, especially certain metalwork in the forge, we need new fresh coals that have been born of sparking trees full of sap. They become the blood of our hottest fires. Then again, we need a variety of coals. Certain coals from certain trees last longer. That’s how a fire gets bonk.”“What’s bonk?” asked Martin.“Ah, it’s an old smithy term.

There is nothing that noble about slaughtering two bad owls in the desert.” The Spotted Owl rose up to her full height and looked down her beak at Gylfie. In a very haughty voice she said,“You have not been tempered by battle yet. Nor do you know the first thing about strategy. You probably don’t even know how to fly with battle claws. I have been here much longer than you and still have not yet become a member of a chaw.”“What’s a chaw?” Soren said.“You are selected to join a chaw— a small team of owls— and you will learn a skill that is helpful.”“In battle?” Twilight asked.“Not just battle— in life. There is more to life than just battles. Each chaw has its own, oh, how should I put it? Personality.

Would he be up to it? He had to be. With his friends, he could. Look what they had accomplished so far!“Do we all get to be in the same chaw?” Soren asked.“Probably not.”“But we’re a band.” Soren hoped that he did not sound as if he were pleading.“That doesn’t matter now.

Soren felt that Gylfie’s question was a perfectly sensible one. What, indeed, was simple about in- visibleness?“Well, young’uns,” Swatums answered,“there is nothing simple. It’s just that it has been said that the Great Ga’Hoole Tree is invisible. That it grows on the island in the middle of a vast sea, a sea called Hoolemere that is nearly as wide as an ocean. A sea that is always wrapped in fog, an island feathered in blizzards, and a tree veiled in mist.”“So,” said Twilight,“it’s not really invisible, it’s just bad weather.”“Not exactly,” replied Swatums. Twilight cocked his head.“It seems that for some the fog lifts, the blizzards stop, and the mist blows away.”“For some?” asked Gylfie.“For those who believe.” Swatums paused and then sniffed in disdain.“But do they say what? Believe in what? No. You see, that is the problem. Owls with fancy ideas— ridiculous! That’s how you get into trouble. Sweetums and I don’t believe in fancy ideas.

Climbing the baggywrinkles and then straight into the gutter. Follow us!” The baggywrinkles were the shredded air currents that lay between the scuppers and the gutter. A power thrust was required to get over them. Soren banked and followed the veteran owl, Poot. Martin was in between the two. The tiny owl would get a boost from Poot’s speed, as a vacuum would be created, through which he could be sucked up and over the baggywrinkles right into the gutter. Ruby was just ahead of him. She let escape a small joyous hoot. And then, suddenly, Soren knew why. Here, at the center of the gale, in the gutter, the winds all seemed to flow like one great turbulent river.

They had moved on.

They made their way slowly through the rows, staring eagerly around. It was only just dawning on Harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world; he had never really thought much about those in other countries. Their fellow campers were starting to wake up. First to stir were the families with small children; Harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before. A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid- shaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent.“How many times, Kevin? You don’t— touch— Daddy’s— wand— yecchh!” She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy’s yells—“You bust slug! You bust slug!” A short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older than Kevin, who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls’ toes to skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron, and Hermione he muttered distractedly,“In broad daylight! Parents having a lie- in, I suppose—” Here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast.

I wonder what’s for dinner, I’m— I’m starving, aren’t you?”“Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.“Oh yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice.“Very interesting dinner— I mean lesson— what’s for eating?” Ron gave Harry a startled look.“Neville, what—?” But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard.“It’s all right, sonny,” he said to Neville.“Why don’t you come up to my office?

In front of them was a pair of tired and grumpy- looking wizards, one of whom was holding a large gold watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly: The man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thigh- length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.“Morning, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured football.“Hello there, Arthur,” said Basil wearily.“Not on duty, eh? It’s all right for some.… We’ve been here all night.… You’d better get out of the way, we’ve got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five- fifteen. Hang on, I’ll find your campsite.… Weasley… Weasley…” He consulted his parchment list.“About a quarter of a mile’s walk over there, first field you come to. Site manager’s called Mr. Roberts. Diggory… second field… ask for Mr. Payne.”“Thanks, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, and he beckoned everyone to follow him. They set off across the deserted moor, unable to make out much through the mist. After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon. They said good- bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door. A man was standing in the doorway",Basil

He was still in the library; the Invisibility Cloak had slipped off his head as he’d slept, and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of Where There’s a Wand, There’s a Way. He sat up, straightening his glasses, blinking in the bright daylight.“Harry Potter needs to hurry!” squeaked Dobby.“The second task starts in ten minutes, and Harry Potter—”“Ten minutes?” Harry croaked.“Ten— ten minutes?” He looked down at his watch.

Voldemort ignored them.“It is a disappointment to me… I confess myself disappointed.…” One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort’s feet.“Master!” he shrieked,“Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!” Voldemort began to laugh.

Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail’s right.“Lucius, my slippery friend,” he whispered, halting before him.“I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle- torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius.… Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay… but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?”“My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,” came Lucius Malfoy’s voice swiftly from beneath the hood.“Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me—”“And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?” said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly.“Yes, I know all about that, Lucius.… You have disappointed me.… I expect more faithful service in the future.”“Of course, my Lord, of course.… You are merciful, thank you.…” Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space— large enough for two people— that separated Malfoy and the next man.",Lucius Malfoy

And then you can go and get your score.” She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say,“How does it feel now, Diggory?” Harry didn’t want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline. He got to his feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he’d reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside— Hermione, followed closely by Ron.“Harry, you were brilliant!” Hermione said squeakily. There were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear.“You were amazing!

Just then, like a shooting star, something red whizzed by.“Beautiful catch, Ruby,” shouted Poot.“What a natural that Short- eared Owl is!” Elvan gasped in amazement.

Indeed, not only was he getting used to it but within the thunderous roar he could seek out smaller sounds, like the sound of Martin’s beating heart, which grew more rapid as he plunged.

Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word“Quidditch,” which was not a word at all.“The— the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said Wormtail.(Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.)“Forgive me, but— I do not understand— why should we wait until the World Cup is over?”“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, checking and double- checking identities. They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait.” Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words“Ministry of Magic,”“wizards,” and“Muggles.” Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of menace in the cold voice now.

Ron, Dean, and Neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some present- opening too. Harry turned back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next to Harry’s bed, still looking worried that he had upset Harry.

Percy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the bank(“Gerroff, Percy, I’m all right!”); Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.“It was ze grindylows… zey attacked me… oh Gabrielle, I thought… I thought…”“Come here, you,” said Madam Pomfrey. She seized Harry and pulled him over to Hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat. Steam gushed out of his ears.“Harry, well done!” Hermione cried.“You did it, you found out how all by yourself!”“Well—” said Harry. He would have told her about Dobby, but he had just noticed Karkaroff watching him. He was the only judge who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur’s sister had got back safely.“Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry, raising",Madam Pomfrey

The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of the stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved to see that she wasn’t giggling.“You— er— look nice,” he said awkwardly.“Thanks,” she said.“Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall,” she added to Ron.“Right,” said Ron, looking around.“Where’s Hermione?” Parvati shrugged.“Shall we go down then, Harry?”“Okay,” said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room. Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole. The entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for eight o’clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open. Those people who were meeting partners from different Houses were edging through the crowd trying to find one another.

The words kept running through Soren’s head. He was flying in ascending circles, effortlessly. He was not singed. He was not burning, and there was this wonderful glowing thing in his beak that, indeed, seemed to flood his entire being with an extraordinary feeling. It was as if every single one of his hollow bones, every feather shaft brimmed with this feeling of transcendent power. Joy filled him, a joy such as he had never felt since perhaps the first time he had ever flown. But how he got this coal was still a mystery to him. He flew back to the ridge where the buckets were. Martin was beside him.“You were spectacular, Soren. I was so nervous when I saw that crown fire break and then when we saw you getting sucked up, I nearly went yeep.”“But what happened?” Soren asked. They were to stay on the ridge until the rest of the chaw returned.“You mean to tell me you don’t know?”“Not exactly.”“You did a reverse loop to escape the pull and as you were coming out of it this coal flew by. Bubo said he never saw a coal of that size go up so high, but you caught it! Caught it on the loop, Soren. I mean it was better flying than anything Ruby has ever done. It was absolutely spectacular.”“Great Glaux, I wish I’d seen it,” Soren said. Martin hooted loudly.“You did it, Soren! You did it!” Otulissa flew in next with Ruby and Poot",Martin

Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw table, where everyone was applauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down. For a fleeting second, Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.“Baddock, Malcolm!”“SLYTHERIN!” The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins. Harry wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other. Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down.“Branstone, Eleanor!”“HUFFLEPUFF!”“Cauldwell, Owen!”“HUFFLEPUFF!”“Creevey, Dennis!” Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid’s moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers’ table. About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming— a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature.

Just don’t stand around, come in and make yourself useful,” Matron called. Soren came slowly into the hollow. The little owl was nearly as small as Gylfie; she was very fluffy, although she smelled of soot and some of her feathers were singed.“Now what did you say your name was, dear?” Matron bent over the Pygmy Owl.“Primrose.”“Yes.

I’m starving.” The Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn’t been present at one since his own. He was quite looking forward to it. Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.“Hiya, Harry!” It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s starting! My brother Dennis!”“Er— good,” said Harry.“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat.“I just hope he’s in Gryffindor!

He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick.“Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t they?” he said.

Down below, it appeared that the female was trying to run across the surface of the water while madly flapping her wings.“Water takeoff— not easy for any of us. We’re not the best fliers, but, as you can see, we can dive. Got these little air pockets so we can go really deep for a long, long time. Getting back to the nest is the hardest part for us.” The male stepped out of the ice hollow and called down.“Dearest, try that patch over there under the lee, the water is smoother.” She gave her mate a withering glance, and somehow through the mouthful of fish yelled back,“You want me to fly directly into the wall, Puff Head! There’s a tailwind. I’ll slam beak- first into it. Then where will your dinner be? If you’re so smart you come down and go fishing yourself.”“Oh, sorry, dear, silly me.” Then he turned to the owls.“We’re really not that bright. I mean we dive well, know how to fish, and deal with ice, but that’s about it.” But, in fact, the puffins knew more and were not that dumb at all.“Just low self- esteem,” Gylfie said. The puffins, in addition to knowing how to dive and fish, knew weather. And just now they were telling them that there would be a small pocket of time when the wind would turn, and they could leave before the next storm came in.“You see, young’uns,” said the male puffin,“nine days out often, the wind slams full force up",the female

It was dull work, requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles.“I’ve got two Neptunes here,” said Harry after a while, frowning down at his piece of parchment,“that can’t be right, can it?”“Aaaaah,” said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney’s mystical whisper,“when two Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, Harry…” Seamus and Dean, who were working nearby, sniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from Lavender Brown—“Oh Professor, look! I think I’ve got an unaspected planet! Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?”“It is Uranus, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, peering down at the chart.“Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?” said Ron. Most unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him, and it was this, perhaps, that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class.“A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you, with reference to your personal chart,” she snapped, sounding much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy- fairy self.“I want it ready to hand in next Monday, and no excuses!”“Miserable old bat,” said Ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner.“",Lavender Brown

For that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Firebolt, he needed—“Hermione,” Harry whispered, when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her.“Hermione— I need you to help me.”“What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, Harry?” she whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning.“Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon.” And so they practiced.

Harry looked at Hermione, thinking… it was true that Snape had saved his life once, but the odd thing was, Snape definitely loathed him, just as he’d loathed Harry’s father when they had been at school together. Snape loved taking points from Harry, and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school.“I don’t care what Moody says,” Hermione",Professor Flitwick

Ron hadn’t spoken to him at all since he had told him about Snape’s detentions.

They went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts, to find Neville there alone, sitting on his bed, reading. He looked a good deal calmer than at the end of Moody’s lesson, though still not entirely normal. His eyes were rather red.“You all right, Neville?” Harry asked him.“Oh yes,” said Neville,“I’m fine, thanks. Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me.…” He held up the book: Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean.“Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I’m really good at Herbology,” Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely heard there before.“He thought I’d like this.” Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything.

Professor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical eye was dancing in its socket.“Nice and easy does the trick, Potter,” he growled.“Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please…” said Professor McGonagall. Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking worried.“Dragons!” she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside. The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric’s shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry’s shoulder, talking furiously all the while.“Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next? You’re very lucky… this is quite shallow… it’ll need cleaning before I heal it up, though.…” She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.“Now, just sit quietly for a minute— sit! And then you can go and get your score.” She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say,“How does it feel now, Diggory?” Harry didn’t want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline. He got to his feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he’d reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside— Hermione, followed closely by Ron.“Harry, you were brilliant!” Hermione said squeakily. There were",Madam Pomfrey

He had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady,“Violet’s just told me everything. Who’s just been chosen as school champion, then?”“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly.“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room. The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred; he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed.“How did you do it without getting a beard?

There’s an even better one my size higher up, but I would need a perch.”“At your service, Gylf!” Twilight was suddenly awake.“What a team we’ll make. On the shoulders of giants, the little Elf will bring back the word!”“Twilight, puhleeze!” Soren said.“Why not? Makes perfect sense.”“Well, I might not be a giant like you, but I can hear better than any of you. I’m going, too. So count me in,” said Soren.“Me, too.” Digger was stretching his legs and seemed at least half awake.“Do you even know what we’re talking about?” Gylfie turned to the Burrowing Owl.“No, but we’re a band, remember? Nobody gets left out. Fill me in on the way to whatever we’re doing.” And so the band of four, as quietly as possible, moved out of their hollow with Gylfie in the lead. They left by the sky opening and flew a quarter way down the tree, where they entered a very small opening that Gylfie had discovered, which twisted and turned, pitched and curled through the huge trunk of the tree, until they had wound around to the back side of the Parliament hollow and found themselves actually slightly beneath that hollow, in the root structure of the tree. It was not that the walls were thin, Soren soon realized. It was rather that the roots of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree were transmitting the sounds. Gylfie hopped on Twilight’s shoulders and Soren pressed one ear to a root, as did Digger.“And so you say,",the Burrowing Owl

They would be awakened at tween time, that time between the last drop of sun and the first shadows of twilight, and then take off across Hoolemere.“Are you nervous, Ruby?” Soren said as they made their way back from the top limbs for their naps.“I’d be a fool not to be,” replied the rusty- feathered owl.“But you fly so well.”“Not to mention,” Martin added,“that both of you are about twice as big as me.”“What are you most scared of?” Soren asked.“That thing they call crowning,” Ruby said quickly.“When the fire leaps from treetop to treetop. I can’t imagine what it does to the air. I mean, flying through it must be almost impossible. You could never even half guess where the dead falls might be.”“Technically, the fire does that”—Otulissa had caught up with them—“because the fire climbs what is called, according to the literature, a fuel ladder.”“Yes, and think of me,” Martin now spoke.“I am on the ground, supposedly looking for the smallest embers.

He was quite looking forward to it. Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.“Hiya, Harry!” It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s starting! My brother Dennis!”“Er— good,” said Harry.“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat.“I just hope he’s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?”“Er— yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick.“Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor.“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione.“Parvati Patil’s twin’s in Ravenclaw, and they’re identical.

The pale blue Beauxbatons carriage looked like a large, chilly, frosted pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was Hagrid’s cabin, while the Durmstrang ship’s portholes were glazed with ice, the rigging white with frost. The house- elves down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich, warming stews and savory puddings, and only Fleur Delacour seemed to be able to find anything to complain about.“It is too’ eavy, all zis’ Ogwarts food,” they heard her saying grumpily as they left the Great Hall behind her one evening(Ron skulking behind Harry, keen not to be spotted by Fleur).“I will not fit into my dress robes!”“Oooh there’s a tragedy,” Hermione snapped as Fleur went out into the entrance hall.“She really thinks a lot of herself, that one, doesn’t she?”“Hermione— who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron.

Urgent message from the Ministry!” Harry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came clattering past with his robes on back- to- front and hurtled out of sight. When Harry and the others entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers—“I’ve got a quill here somewhere!”— and Mr. Weasley bending over the fire, talking to— Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly. Amos Diggory’s head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large, bearded egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears.“… Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went and called those what- d’you- call-’ems— please- men. Arthur, you’ve got to get over there—”“Here!” said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a piece of parchment, a bottle of ink, and a crumpled quill into Mr. Weasley’s hands.“— it’s a real stroke of luck I heard about it,” said Mr. Diggory’s head.“I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls, and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off— if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one, Arthur—”“What does Mad- Eye say happened?” asked Mr. Weasley, unscrewing the ink bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take notes. Mr. Diggory’s head rolled its eyes.“Says he heard an intruder in his yard. Says he was creeping toward the house, but was",Amos Diggory
"“There’s one— the Cruciatus Curse,”",70350,70359,True,349:Neville.M,"acting of their own free will.“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better avoid being hit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he barked, and everyone jumped. Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?” Hermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry’s slight surprise, did Neville’s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was Herbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville looked surprised at his own daring.“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to fix on Neville.“There’s one— the Cruciatus Curse,” said Neville in a small but distinct voice. Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes.“Your name’s Longbottom?” he said, his magical eye swooping down to check the register again. Neville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries. Turning back to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to move.“The Cruciatus Curse,” said Moody.“Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea,” he said, pointing his wand at the spider.“Engorgio!” The spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward,",Neville
"“my wife knows I’m up here,",5104,5121,True,175:Frank.M,"You heard everything, Muggle?” said the cold voice.“What’s that you’re calling me?” said Frank defiantly, for now that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war.“I am calling you a Muggle,” said the voice coolly.“It means that you are not a wizard.”“I don’t know what you mean by wizard,” said Frank, his voice growing steadier.“All I know is I’ve heard enough to interest the police tonight, I have. You’ve done murder and you’re planning more! And I’ll tell you this too,” he added, on a sudden inspiration,“my wife knows I’m up here, and if I don’t come back—”“You have no wife,” said the cold voice, very quietly.“Nobody knows you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows… he always knows.…”“Is that right?” said Frank roughly.“Lord, is it? Well, I don’t think much of your manners, My Lord. Turn’ round and face me like a man, why don’t you?”“But I am not a man, Muggle,” said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames.“I am much, much more than a man. However… why not? I will face you.… Wormtail, come turn my chair around",Frank
