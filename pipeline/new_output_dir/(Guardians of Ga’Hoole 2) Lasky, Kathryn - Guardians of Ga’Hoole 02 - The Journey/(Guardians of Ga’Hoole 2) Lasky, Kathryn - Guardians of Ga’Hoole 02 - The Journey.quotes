371	383	385	385	Twilight	123	“ Let ’s keep flying even though it ’s getting light , ”
398	409	385	385	Twilight	123	“ We ’re getting nearer . I just feel it . ”
1218	1221	1222	1222	she	128	“ Soren , ”
1225	1252	1222	1222	she	128	“ I ’m not sure if it is a good idea to keep flying with all this light . We do n’t want to get mobbed . ”
1253	1256	1257	1257	Soren	122	“ Mobbed ? ”
1260	1266	1284	1284	her	128	“ You know , crows . ”
1306	1311	1312	1312	Gylfie	125	“ Crow to windward ! ”
1325	1331	1333	1333	Twilight	123	“ We ’re being mobbed ! ”
1456	1459	1460	1460	Gylfie	125	“ Scatter ! ”
1464	1469	1460	1460	Gylfie	125	“ Scatter and loop . ”
1549	1557	1559	1560	Mrs. P.	128	“ I feel one coming up behind , ”
1561	1568	1559	1560	Mrs. P.	128	“ Off your windward tail feathers . ”
1662	1681	1682	1682	she	120	“ Scum of the sky , curse of the earth , riffraff of the Yonder . Scurrilous crowilous , ”
1723	1726	1715	1716	Mrs. P.	128	last—“Wet pooper ! ”
1769	1773	1765	1765	they	300	“ wet poopers . ”
1826	1829	1824	1824	He	122	“ yeep , ”
1864	1869	1855	1855	Twilight	123	“ Digger ’s hurt . ”
1892	1903	1883	1885	the Burrowing Owl	302	“ We ’ve got to find a place to land . ”
1909	1929	1904	1904	Gylfie	125	“ I do n’t know how much longer Digger can last . He ’s not flying straight at all . ”
1930	1937	1938	1939	Mrs. P.	128	“ Which way is he tipping ? ”
1942	1945	1947	1947	Twilight	123	“ Downwind , ”
1949	1952	1953	1953	she	128	“ Quick ! ”
1956	1970	1953	1953	she	128	“ Let ’s get over there . I might be able to help . ”
1971	1974	1975	1975	Twilight	123	“ You ? ”
1980	2007	1975	1975	Twilight	123	“ Remember , dear , how Digger had been asking me to ride on his back in the desert ? This might just be the time . ”
2022	2025	2026	2026	Soren	122	“ Digger , ”
2029	2036	2026	2026	Soren	122	“ we know you ’re hurt . ”
2037	2048	2049	2051	the Burrowing Owl	127	“ I do n’t know if I can make it , ”
2054	2063	2049	2051	the Burrowing Owl	127	“ Oh , if I could only walk . ”
2064	2074	2075	2075	Soren	122	“ There ’s a stand of trees really close , ”
2078	2089	2075	2075	Soren	122	“ Mrs. P. has an idea that might help you . ”
2090	2095	2049	2051	the Burrowing Owl	127	“ What ’s that ? ”
2096	2142	2075	2075	Soren	122	“ She ’s going to get on your good wing . That will tip your injured wing up again , lighten the drag on it . Gylfie meanwhile will fly under your bad wing and create a little updraft for it . It might work . ”
2143	2149	2150	2150	Digger	126	“ I do n’t know , ”
2154	2161	2163	2164	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Faith , boy ! Faith ! ”
2166	2175	2163	2164	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Now let ’s get on with it . ”
2176	2187	2188	2188	Digger	126	“ I really do n’t think I can make it , ”
2191	2200	2204	2204	Her	128	“ You can , boy ! You can ! ”
2210	2298	2204	2204	Her	128	“ You shall go on to the finish . You shall fly to the forests , to the trees , to Hoolemere . You have defended yourself against these crows . You have strode across deserts . You shall defend yourself now by flying . You shall fly into the wind , into the light , into this new day . Whatever the cost , you shall fly on . You shall not fail or falter . You shall not weaken . You shall finish the flight . ”
2349	2357	2342	2342	They	305	“ Now , Mrs. P. ! Go ! ”
2444	2458	2426	2426	she	128	“ Almost there , dear , almost there . Steady now . Steady . ”
2503	2517	2518	2518	Twilight	123	“ We ’re bringin ’ him in ! We ’re bringing him in ! ”
2584	2618	2574	2575	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ I need worms ! Big fat ones , and leeches . Quick — all of you ! Go out and get me what I need . I ’ll stay here with Digger . ”
2627	2651	2654	2654	she	120	“ Now , this wo n’t hurt , dear , but I just want to feel what those awful crows did to you . ”
2664	2722	2654	2654	she	120	“ It ’s not deep . The best thing I can do is to curl up right on the wound until they come back . A snake ’s skin can be very healing in many cases . We ’re a little too dry for the long run , however . That ’s why I want the worms . ”
2750	2766	2739	2739	She	120	“ That will cleanse it . I ca n’t tell you how filthy crows are ! ”
2792	2798	2789	2789	Digger	126	“ That feels so good . ”
2799	2826	2851	2851	his	126	“ Yes , there ’s nothing like a fat slimy worm for relief of a wound . You ’ll be fit to fly by tomorrow night . ”
2827	2838	2839	2839	Digger	126	“ Thank you , Mrs. P. Thank you so much . ”
2901	2911	2912	2912	Gylfie	125	“ They look almost exactly like you , Soren , ”
2915	2923	2912	2912	Gylfie	125	“ And they ’re coming to visit . ”
2924	2932	2933	2933	Soren	122	“ Masked Owls look nothing like me , ”
2975	2983	2984	2985	Mrs. P.	128	“ They ’re coming here to visit ? ”
2988	3013	2984	2985	Mrs. P.	128	“ Oh , dear , the place is a mess . We ca n’t receive company now . I ’m nursing this poor owl . ”
3014	3021	3022	3022	Gylfie	125	“ They heard about the mobbing , ”
3025	3034	3022	3022	Gylfie	125	“ We ’re even a little bit famous . ”
3035	3040	3042	3042	Soren	122	“ Why ’s that ? ”
3044	3065	3066	3066	Gylfie	125	“ I guess that gang of crows is really bad . They could n’t believe we battled back and survived , ”
3084	3090	3078	3078	One	134	“ Mind if we visit ? ”
3131	3137	3138	3138	Soren	122	“ See what I mean ? ”
3143	3159	3138	3138	Soren	122	“ They are completely different . Look at how much bigger and darker they are . ”
3167	3180	3182	3183	the owl	319	“ We wanted to meet the brave owls who battled the crows , ”
3187	3197	3198	3207	a very young owlet who had barely fledged peeped up	321	“ Yeah , how ’d you ever do that ? ”
3209	3219	3220	3220	Twilight	123	“ Oh , it was n’t all that hard , ”
3229	3234	3235	3236	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Not that hard ! ”
3240	3248	3235	3236	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Hardest thing I ’ve ever done ! ”
3249	3252	3253	3256	the male Masked Owl	322	“ You ! ”
3259	3280	3281	3282	his mate	323	“ She certainly had nothing to do with the defeat of the crows . She ’s a nest - maid , ”
3313	3322	3323	3323	Soren	122	“ She had everything to do with it ! ”
3337	3367	3323	3323	Soren	122	“ If it had n’t been for Mrs. P. , I would have been dive - bombed from the rear and poor Digger would have never made it back . ”
3373	3378	3368	3370	The Masked Owls	132	“ Well , well . ”
3392	3426	3379	3381	The large female	324	“ We just are n’t used to such aggressive behavior from our nest - maids . Ours are rather meek , I guess , compared to this … What do you call her ? ”
3427	3434	3435	3435	Soren	122	“ Her name is Mrs. Plithiver , ”
3449	3454	3455	3456	the female	325	“ Yes , yes , ”
3460	3480	3455	3456	the female	325	“ Well , we discourage our nest - maids from socially mingling with us at any time , really . ”
3481	3498	3499	3499	Twilight	123	“ That was hardly a party , what happened up there in the sky , ma’am , ”
3503	3512	3514	3515	the male	326	“ Well , now tell me , young’uns , ”
3527	3538	3518	3518	he	326	“ Where are you heading ? What are your plans ? ”
3539	3551	3552	3552	Soren	122	“ We ’re going to Hoolemere and the Great Ga’Hoole Tree , ”
3555	3561	3562	3563	the female	325	“ Oh , how interesting , ”
3576	3581	3583	3585	the young owlet	328	“ Oh , Mummy , ”
3587	3603	3583	3585	the young owlet	328	“ That ’s the place I was telling you about . Ca n’t we go ? ”
3604	3617	3562	3563	the female	325	“ Nonsense . You know how we feel about make - believe . ”
3627	3635	3637	3637	Gylfie	125	“ It ’s not make - believe , ”
3639	3650	3652	3653	the male	326	“ Oh , you ca n’t be serious , young’un , ”
3655	3666	3652	3653	the male	326	“ It ’s just a story , an old legend . ”
3667	3674	3676	3677	the female	325	“ Let me tell you something , ”
3689	3782	3783	3783	She	325	“ It does not do any good to believe in things you can not see , touch , or feel . It is a waste of time . From the look of your flight feathers ’ development , not to mention your talons , it is apparent that you are either fly - aways or orphans . Why else would you be out cavorting about the skies at such dangerous hours of the morning ? I think your parents would be ashamed of you . I can tell you have good breeding . ”
3841	3856	3859	3860	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ I am ashamed of anyone who has eyes and still can not see . ”
3871	3888	3862	3862	She	120	“ But , of course , to see with two eyes is a very common thing . ”
3889	3896	3898	3899	the male	326	“ What is she talking about ? ”
3901	3925	3927	3928	the female	325	“ What happened to the old days when servants served and were quiet ? Imagine a nest - maid going on like this , ”
3930	3935	3937	3938	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Oh , yes , ”
3940	3955	3956	3956	She	120	“ And I shall go on a bit more , if you permit me . ”
3972	3983	3984	3984	Soren	122	“ Of course , Mrs. Plithiver . Please go on , ”
3987	4006	4009	4009	she	120	“ I am a blind snake , but who says I can not see as much as you ? ”
4045	4176	4031	4032	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Who says I can not see ? To see with eyes is so ordinary . I see with my whole body — my skin , my bones , the coiling of my spine . And between the slow beats of my very slow heart , I sense the world here and beyond . I know the Yonder . Oh , yes . I have known it even before I ever flew in it . But before that day did I say it did not exist ? What a fool you would have called me , milady , had I said your sky does not exist because I can not see it nor can I fly . And what a fool you are to believe that Hoolemere does not exist . ”
4177	4183	4185	4187	the Masked Owl	337	“ Well , I never ! ”
4197	4204	4189	4189	She	337	“ She called me a fool ! ”
4210	4287	4206	4207	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Sky does not exist merely in the wings of birds , an impulse in their feathers and blood and bone . Sky becomes the Yonder for all creatures if , indeed , they free their hearts and their brains to feel , to know in the deepest ways . And when the Yonder calls , it speaks to all of us , be it sky , be it Hoolemere , be it heaven or glaumora . ”
4300	4304	4305	4306	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ So perhaps , ”
4309	4324	4305	4306	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ there are some who need to lose their eyes to discover their sight . ”
4357	4364	4369	4369	she	120	“ No more flying during light , ”
4377	4380	4369	4369	she	120	“ Agreed ? ”
4381	4384	4369	4369	she	120	“ Agreed , ”
4694	4694	4683	4683	they	352	”
4695	4706	4708	4710	the Sooty Owl	141	“ Well , it ’s not exactly that , Sweetums , ”
4793	4804	4808	4809	the male	326	“ Left the nest a year ago . Still nearby , ”
4811	4848	4808	4809	the male	326	“ But who knows , Sweetums might come up with another clutch of eggs in the new breeding season . And if she does n’t , well , we two are enough company for each other . ”
5078	5112	5072	5072	Sweetums	140	“ Well , what do you mean , Swatums , by ‘ not exactly . ’ Is n’t it either a legend or not ? I mean , it ’s not really real . ”
5113	5125	5183	5183	Gylfie	125	“ Well , Sweetums , some say it ’s simply invisible . ”
5126	5134	5135	5135	Gylfie	125	“ What ’s simple about being invisible ? ”
5138	5145	5146	5149	The two Sooty Owls	368	“ Ohh , hooo - hooo . ”
5155	5168	5183	5183	Gylfie	125	“ Does n’t she remind you of Tibby , Swa - tums ? ”
5203	5208	5209	5209	Swatums	142	“ Well , young’uns , ”
5212	5283	5209	5209	Swatums	142	“ there is nothing simple . It ’s just that it has been said that the Great Ga’Hoole Tree is invisible . That it grows on the island in the middle of a vast sea , a sea called Hoolemere that is nearly as wide as an ocean . A sea that is always wrapped in fog , an island feathered in blizzards , and a tree veiled in mist . ”
5284	5287	5289	5289	Twilight	123	“ So , ”
5291	5304	5289	5289	Twilight	123	“ it ’s not really invisible , it ’s just bad weather . ”
5305	5309	5311	5311	Swatums	142	“ Not exactly , ”
5318	5338	5313	5313	Twilight	123	“ It seems that for some the fog lifts , the blizzards stop , and the mist blows away . ”
5339	5343	5345	5345	Gylfie	125	“ For some ? ”
5347	5353	5354	5354	Swatums	142	“ For those who believe . ”
5362	5434	5354	5354	Swatums	142	“ But do they say what ? Believe in what ? No . You see , that is the problem . Owls with fancy ideas — ridiculous ! That ’s how you get into trouble . Sweetums and I do n’t believe in fancy ideas . Fancy ideas do n’t keep the belly full and the gizzard grinding . Sugar gliders , plump rats , voles — that ’s what counts . ”
5499	5505	5495	5495	Gylfie	125	“ You awake , Soren ? ”
5506	5518	5530	5530	Gylfie	125	“ Yeah . I ca n’t wait to get to Hoolemere . ”
5519	5529	5530	5530	Gylfie	125	“ Me , neither . But I was wondering , ”
5533	5537	5530	5530	Gylfie	125	“ Wondering what ? ”
5538	5556	5557	5557	Streak	143	“ Do you think that Streak and Zan love each other as much as Sweetums and Swatums ? ”
5667	5673	5674	5674	he	122	“ I do n’t know , ”
5677	5702	5674	5674	he	122	“ It ’s hard thinking about mates . I mean , can you imagine ever having a mate or what he might be like ? ”
5709	5714	5716	5716	Gylfie	125	“ Honestly , no , ”
5726	5740	5741	5741	Digger	126	“ If I never taste another sugar glider it will be too soon . ”
5745	5752	5741	5741	Digger	126	“ They keep repeating on me . ”
5818	5830	5831	5831	Soren	122	“ What do you mean ‘ keep repeating on you ’ ? ”
5846	5862	5863	5863	Digger	126	“ Just an expression . My dad used to say that after he ate centipedes . ”
5866	5905	5863	5863	Digger	126	“ And then Ma would say , ‘ Well , of course they keep repeating on you , dear . You eat something that has all those legs , they ’re probably still running around inside you . ’ ”
5920	5932	5916	5916	Digger	126	“ My mom was really funny . I miss her jokes . ”
5933	5937	5939	5939	Gylfie	125	“ Come on , ”
5941	5947	5939	5939	Gylfie	125	“ You ’ll be okay . ”
5948	6018	5916	5916	Digger	126	“ But everything is so different here . I do n’t live in trees . Never have in my life . I ’m a Burrowing Owl . I lived in desert burrows . I do n’t hunt these silly creatures that glide and fly about through the limbs . I miss the taste of snake and crawly things that pick up the dirt . Whoops , sorry , Mrs. P. ”
6019	6067	5939	5939	Gylfie	125	“ Do n’t apologize , Digger . Most owls do eat snakes , not usually blind snakes , since we tend their nests , but other snakes . Soren ’s parents were particularly sensitive and , out of respect for me , would not eat any snake . ”
6093	6132	6133	6133	Gylfie	125	“ He ’s not going to be able to see anything in this light . I do n’t care how good his eyes are . A black trickle of a creek in a dark forest — forget it , ”
6151	6158	6159	6159	Digger	126	“ What is it , Soren ? ”
6162	6167	6168	6168	Twilight	123	“ You hear something ? ”
6183	6186	6187	6187	Soren	122	“ Hush ! ”
6223	6259	6219	6219	Soren	122	“ There is a trickle . I hear it . It ’s not a lot of water , but I can hear that it begins in reeds and then it starts to slide over stones . ”
6304	6313	6314	6314	Soren	122	“ Let ’s go . I ’ll lead , ”
6407	6414	6415	6415	Gylfie	125	“ A masterful job of triangulation , ”
6418	6430	6415	6415	Gylfie	125	“ Simply masterful , Soren . You are a premiere navigator . ”
6431	6437	6438	6438	Digger	126	“ What ’s she saying ? ”
6441	6457	6438	6438	Digger	126	“ She ’s saying that Soren got us here . Big words , little owl . ”
6468	6476	6477	6477	Digger	126	“ So now what do we do ? ”
6480	6490	6491	6491	Twilight	123	“ Follow the river to the Sea of Hoolemere , ”
6494	6508	6491	6491	Twilight	123	“ Come on . We still have a few hours until First Light . ”
6509	6513	6514	6514	Digger	126	“ More flying ? ”
6517	6525	6526	6526	Twilight	123	“ What ? You want to walk ? ”
6529	6552	6491	6491	Twilight	123	“ I would n’t mind . My wings are tired . And it ’s not just my wound . It ’s healed . ”
6580	6591	6563	6563	Gylfie	125	“ Wings do n’t get tired . That ’s impossible . ”
6592	6606	6553	6556	The three other owls	251	“ Well , mine do . Ca n’t we rest up a bit ? ”
6654	6661	6663	6663	Soren	122	“ I ’m hungry , anyhow , ”
6665	6676	6663	6663	Soren	122	“ Let me see if I can catch us something . ”
6677	6684	6685	6685	Digger	126	“ Please , no sugar gliders , ”
6718	6729	6730	6730	Gylfie	125	“ Refreshing , is n’t it , after sugar gliders ? ”
6733	6736	6737	6737	Digger	126	“ Hmmm ! ”
6747	6760	6761	6761	Soren	122	“ What do you think the Great Ga’Hoole Tree will be like ? ”
6777	6789	6790	6790	Gylfie	125	“ Different from St. Aggie ’s , that ’s for sure , ”
6793	6814	6815	6815	Soren	122	“ Do you think they know about St. Aggie’s — the raids , the egg snatching , the … the … ”
6818	6822	6823	6823	Digger	126	“ The cannibalism , ”
6826	6853	6823	6823	Digger	126	“ You might as well say it , Soren . Do n’t try to protect me . I ’ve seen the worst and I know it . ”
7329	7339	7340	7340	Gylfie	125	“ Got that out of your system , Twilight ? ”
7343	7355	7373	7373	his	123	“ What do you mean ‘ out of my system ’ ? ”
7356	7360	7373	7373	his	123	“ Your aggression . ”
7376	7383	7373	7373	his	123	“ Big words , little owl . ”
7403	7409	7410	7411	Mrs. P.	128	“ Well now , young’uns , ”
7416	7450	7410	7411	Mrs. P.	128	“ Let ’s not get into it . I think , Gylfie , that in the face of cannibalism , aggression or going stark raving yoicks and absolutely annihilating the cannibals is appropriate . ”
7451	7467	7468	7468	Twilight	123	“ More big words but I like them . I like them , Mrs. P. , ”
7735	7740	7731	7731	Digger	126	“ I see something ! ”
7747	7759	7731	7731	Digger	126	“ It ’s , it’s … whitish … Well , grayish . ”
7760	7773	7774	7774	Twilight	123	“ Ish ? What in Glaux ’s name is ‘ ish ’ ? ”
7777	7781	7785	7785	her	125	“ It means , ”
7789	7804	7785	7785	her	125	“ that it ’s not exactly white , and it ’s not exactly gray . ”
7805	7821	7785	7785	her	125	“ I ’ll have a look . Hold your flight pattern until I get back . ”
7841	7856	7857	7857	Twilight	123	“ And you know why it ’s not exactly gray and not exactly white ? ”
7865	7871	7857	7857	Twilight	123	“ Because it ’s smoke . ”
7872	7875	7876	7878	The other three	428	“ Smoke ? ”
7882	7890	7891	7891	Twilight	123	“ You do know what smoke is ? ”
7916	7920	7921	7921	Soren	122	“ Sort of , ”
7924	7941	7921	7921	Soren	122	“ You mean there ’s a forest fire down there ? I ’ve heard of those . ”
7942	7984	7921	7921	Soren	122	“ Oh , no . Nothing that big . Maybe once it was . But , really , the forests of The Beaks are minor ones . Second - rate . Few and far between and not much to catch fire . ”
7985	7992	7993	7993	Gylfie	125	“ Spontaneous combustion — no doubt , ”
8043	8052	8035	8035	he	123	“ Come on , let ’s go explore . ”
8104	8107	8108	8108	Twilight	123	“ Digger , ”
8111	8128	8108	8108	Twilight	123	“ Can you dig as well as you can walk with those naked legs of yours ? ”
8129	8158	8231	8231	she	125	“ You bet . How do you think we fix up our burrows or make them bigger ? We just do n’t settle for what we happen upon . ”
8159	8195	8108	8108	Twilight	123	“ Well , start digging and show the rest of us how . We ’ve got to bury these coals before a wind comes up and carries them off and really gets a fire going . ”
8220	8227	8228	8228	Gylfie	125	“ I wonder what happened here ? ”
8293	8297	8298	8298	she	125	“ Battle claws ! ”
8310	8317	8286	8286	she	125	“ Get out ! Get out ! ”
8367	8370	8371	8371	Twilight	123	“ Bobcat ! ”
8428	8434	8438	8438	she	125	“ Good Glaux , Soren ! ”
8490	8497	8498	8498	Twilight	123	“ Well , bust my gizzard ! ”
8501	8517	8498	8498	Twilight	123	“ Soren , you dropped that coal right on the cat ! What a shot ! ”
8518	8523	8498	8498	Twilight	123	“ I — what ? ”
8524	8539	8498	8498	Twilight	123	“ Come on , we ’re going in for him — for the kill . ”
8540	8544	8545	8545	Soren	122	“ The kill ? ”
8549	8579	8545	8545	Soren	122	“ Follow me . Aim for his eyes . Gylfie , stay clear of his tail . I ’ll go for the throat . Digger , take a flank . ”
8717	8728	8729	8729	Soren	122	“ Was he after the battle claws — a bobcat ? ”
8817	8820	8821	8821	Twilight	123	“ No , ”
8839	8849	8825	8825	He	123	“ The cat was after what was in here . ”
8850	8855	8856	8859	the three other owls	251	“ What ’s that ? ”
8864	8869	8874	8874	she	120	“ A dying owl , ”
8886	8906	8874	8874	she	120	“ Come in . I think he wants to speak , if he has any more breath in him . ”
8967	8974	8975	8977	The Barred Owl	155	“ Do n’t blame the cat . ”
8980	8989	8975	8977	The Barred Owl	155	“ Only here after … after … they — ”
8990	8997	8998	8998	Gylfie	125	“ After they what , sir ? ”
9016	9027	9030	9030	his	122	“ They wanted the battle claws , did n’t they ? ”
9062	9069	9070	9070	Glyfie	156	“ Was it St. Aggie ’s ? ”
9074	9103	9104	9105	The owl	319	“ I wish it had been St. Aggie ’s . It was something far worse . Believe me — if St. Aggie’s — Oh ! You only wish ! ”
9125	9130	9131	9131	Digger	126	“ You only wish ! ”
9134	9147	9131	9131	Digger	126	“ Does he mean there ’s something worse than St. Aggie ’s ? ”
9148	9154	9155	9155	Soren	122	“ How could there be ? ”
9158	9164	9165	9165	Gylfie	125	“ What is this place ? ”
9168	9198	9165	9165	Gylfie	125	“ Why are there battle claws here but it is n’t a battlefield ? If it had been , we would have seen other owls , wounded or dead . ”
9206	9209	9210	9210	Soren	122	“ Twilight ? ”
9221	9344	9217	9217	Twilight	123	“ I ’m not sure . I ’ve heard tell of owls — very clever owls that live apart , never mate , not really belonging to any kingdom . Do for themselves for the most part . Sometimes hire out for battles . Hireclaws , I think they call them . Maybe this was one . And the The Beaks is a funny place , you know . Not many forests . Mostly ridges like the ones we ’ve been flying over the last day or so . A few woods in between . So not a lot of places for owls to fetch up . No really big trees with big hollows . Probably a real loner , this fellow . ”
9354	9362	9363	9363	Soren	122	“ What should we do with him ? ”
9366	9401	9363	9363	Soren	122	“ I hate to leave him here for the next bobcat to come along . He tried to warn us , after all . He said , ‘ Get out ! Get out ! ’ ”
9413	9431	9404	9404	Digger	126	“ And , you know , I do n’t think he was warning us about the bobcat . ”
9432	9436	9437	9437	Gylfie	125	“ You think , ”
9445	9461	9437	9437	Gylfie	125	“ that it was about these others , the ones worse than St. Aggie ’s ? ”
9465	9484	9485	9485	Soren	122	“ But we ca n’t just leave him . This was a brave owl … A noble owl . ”
9489	9508	9485	9485	Soren	122	“ He was noble even if he did n’t live at the Great Tree as a knightly owl . ”
9513	9555	9509	9509	Twilight	123	“ Soren ’s right . He was a brave owl . I do n’t want to leave him for dirty old scavengers . If it ’s not the bobcats , it ’ll be the crows ; if not crows , vultures . ”
9556	9565	9566	9566	Digger	126	“ But what can we do with him ? ”
9569	9582	9583	9583	Twilight	123	“ I ’ve heard of burial hollows , high up in trees , ”
9586	9607	9583	9583	Twilight	123	“ When I was with a Whiskered Screech family in Ambala that ’s what they did when their grandmother died . ”
9608	9624	9625	9625	Gylfie	125	“ It ’s going to take too long to find a hollow in The Beaks , ”
9629	9649	9625	9625	Gylfie	125	“ You said it yourself , Twilight — it ’s a second - rate forest , no big trees . ”
9655	9705	9650	9650	Soren	122	“ This owl lived in this cave . Look , you can tell . There ’s some fresh pellets just outside , and there ’s a stash of nuts and over there , a vole killed not long ago — probably his next dinner … I think we should — ”
9706	9716	9717	9717	Gylfie	125	“ We ca n’t leave him in the cave , ”
9720	9737	9717	9717	Gylfie	125	“ Even if it is his home . Another bobcat can come along and find him . ”
9738	9744	9745	9745	Digger	126	“ But Soren is right , ”
9748	9754	9745	9745	Digger	126	“ His spirit is here . ”
9878	9890	9910	9910	His	122	“ His spirit is in this cave . I feel it . ”
9891	9898	9899	9899	Twilight	123	“ So what do we do ? ”
9922	9961	9962	9962	Soren	122	“ He had many fires in this cave . Look at the walls — as sooty as a Sooty Owl ’s wings . I think he made things with fires in this pit right here . I think … ”
9967	9975	9962	9962	Soren	122	“ I think we should burn him . ”
9976	9980	9981	9984	the other three owls	454	“ Burn him ? ”
9988	10008	10009	10010	The owls	455	“ Yes . Right here in this pit . The embers are still burning . It will be enough . ”
10046	10055	10056	10056	Gylfie	125	“ Do we have to stay and watch ? ”
10066	10069	10070	10070	Soren	122	“ No ! ”
10145	10166	10124	10125	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ I am proud of you , Soren . You have protected a brave owl against the indignities of scavengers . ”
10174	10176	10167	10167	Soren	122	“ indignities ”
10600	10607	10608	10608	Gylfie	125	“ It ’s simply dreamy here , ”
10850	10853	10854	10854	he	122	“ Da ! ”
10857	10870	10871	10872	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ It ’s not your da . It ’s you , dear , ”
10903	10914	10891	10891	she	120	“ You ’ve probably never seen your face fully fledged . ”
10915	10932	10871	10872	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ It ’s all white , just like Da ’s . I ’m so , so — ”
10933	10936	10937	10938	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Handsome ? ”
10941	10946	10947	10947	Soren	122	“ Well , yeah . ”
11039	11042	11044	11044	they	482	“ wingies , ”
11110	11119	11172	11172	ME	0	“ Look at me bounce off this cloud ! ”
11132	11140	11129	11129	Twilight	123	“ I Am More Beautiful Than a Cloud ”
11232	11235	11236	11237	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ But , ”
11245	11260	11236	11237	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ you ai n’t , as you say , ‘ rolling off clouds ’ ! ”
11550	11560	11610	11610	Gylfie	125	“ Come here this instant ! All of you ! ”
11602	11604	11598	11598	He	122	“ character ”
11613	11623	11642	11643	Mrs. P.	128	“ Mrs. P. , what in Glaux ’s name ? ”
11624	11630	11631	11631	she	120	“ I ’ll Glaux you ! ”
11671	11674	11675	11675	Twilight	123	“ Hey , ”
11678	11689	11675	11675	Twilight	123	“ did you catch that curled wingie I just did ? ”
11690	11697	11642	11643	Mrs. P.	128	“ Racdrops on your curled wingie . ”
11722	11730	11731	11731	Soren	122	“ What ’s wrong , Mrs. P. ? ”
11738	11773	11716	11716	She	120	“ What ’s wrong ? Look at me . Stop looking at yourselves in the lake this instant . I ’ll tell you what ’s wrong . You are a disgrace to your families . ”
11774	11786	11787	11787	Twilight	123	“ I have no family if you ’ll recall , Mrs. P. ”
11790	11807	11787	11787	Twilight	123	“ Worse then ! You are a disgrace to your species . The Great Gray Owls . ”
11814	11818	11811	11811	Twilight	123	“ My species ? ”
11819	11853	11854	11855	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Yes , indeed . All of you are , for that matter . You have all grown fat , lazy , and vain , the lot of you . Why … why , ”
11866	11878	11716	11716	She	120	“ You ’re no better than a bunch of wet poopers ! ”
11934	11943	11944	11945	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ We ’re getting out of here NOW ! ”
11955	11966	11944	11945	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ What about crows ? It ’s not dark yet . ”
11967	11970	11971	11971	she	120	“ Tough ! ”
11974	11984	11985	11985	Gylfie	125	“ Are you going to sacrifice us to crows ? ”
11993	12007	11985	11985	Gylfie	125	“ You ’re sacrificing yourself right here on the shores of this lake . ”
12035	12044	11985	11985	Gylfie	125	“ Get ready to fly ! And Twilight — ”
12045	12050	11985	11985	Gylfie	125	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
12051	12059	11985	11985	Gylfie	125	“ I ’ll fly point with you . ”
12060	12065	11985	11985	Gylfie	125	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
12132	12135	12115	12115	she	128	“ special needs ”
12320	12327	12328	12328	Twilight	123	“ What in Glaux ’s name ? ”
12331	12344	12292	12292	her	120	“ They like you , Twilight . Blessed , I dare say ! ”
12451	12459	12460	12460	he	123	“ Fly in my wake , Gylfie , ”
12480	12512	12471	12471	he	123	“ Her wings have started to ice . Ours will , too — soon . It ’s too dangerous to continue . We have to look for a place to land . ”
12617	12622	12623	12624	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ This is appalling ! ”
12627	12636	12623	12624	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ I ’ve never seen such an infestation . ”
12637	12645	12646	12646	Twilight	123	“ Is n’t there some moss someplace ? ”
12661	12676	12677	12678	Mrs. P.	128	“ Well , if someone wants to go out and look , they can , ”
12681	12701	12677	12678	Mrs. P.	128	“ In the meantime , I ’ll try and eat as many of these maggotty little critters as possible . ”
12708	12744	12702	12702	Soren	122	“ The wind ’s picked up . You ca n’t even see out there . Snow ’s so thick on the ground , I doubt if we could find any moss if we did look . ”
12745	12756	12757	12757	Gylfie	125	“ We can always pulp some of the pine needles , ”
12760	12842	12757	12757	Gylfie	125	“ First , you beak them hard enough , then let them slide down to your first stomach — the one before the gizzard . Hold it there for just a while , and then yarp it all back up . The pine needles come out all mushy and when they dry they ’re almost as soft as moss . Actually , technically speaking , it is not called yarping . It ’s burping when its wet and not a pellet . ”
12843	12854	12855	12855	Twilight	123	“ Who cares — as long as it ’s soft ? ”
12858	12867	12868	12868	Digger	126	“ I suppose it ’s worth a try , ”
12871	12888	12868	12868	Digger	126	“ The thought of going out there into that blizzard is not appealing in the least . ”
12968	12986	12987	12988	Mrs. P.	128	“ I do n’t think I could eat another pinch beetle if my life depended on it , ”
13008	13013	13014	13014	Digger	126	“ What was that ? ”
13017	13024	13025	13025	Twilight	123	“ Yours truly , burping here , ”
13041	13051	13052	13052	Digger	126	“ Oh , I ’ve got to try that ! ”
13151	13155	13157	13158	Mrs. P.	128	“ Absolutely vulgar , ”
13233	13246	13247	13247	Soren	122	“ Oh , what I would n’t give for a nice vole . ”
13250	13271	13272	13273	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ You know , young’un , I think the wind is lessening . I think maybe we should take off . ”
13316	13322	13323	13323	Digger	126	“ You call this less ? ”
13330	13359	13326	13326	his	126	“ A bit , and believe me , dear , sitting there burping pine needles is n’t going to get you any closer to the Great Ga’Hoole Tree . ”
13409	13416	13417	13417	Twilight	123	“ There are cliffs to windward . ”
13425	13448	13417	13417	Twilight	123	“ I think that if we could get under the lee of them we might be protected and able to fly better . ”
13449	13466	13467	13467	Soren	122	“ Sounds like it ’s worth a try . We ’d better get Gylfie between us , ”
13508	13517	13501	13501	Gylfie	125	“ All right , let ’s crab upwind , ”
13711	13718	13719	13719	he	122	“ Hang on , Mrs. Plithiver , ”
13837	13848	13879	13879	she	125	“ Lucky for you and you and you and what ? ”
13857	13865	13866	13866	Soren	122	“ Who ? Who ’s that talking ? ”
13869	13875	13879	13879	she	125	“ Oh , great Glaux ! ”
13885	13890	13879	13879	she	125	“ What in the … ”
13961	13969	13958	13958	Gylfie	125	“ What are they ? Not birds . ”
13970	13975	13976	13976	Twilight	123	“ No , never , ”
13979	13991	13992	13992	Gylfie	125	“ Do you think they ’re part of the animal kingdom ? ”
13995	14002	14003	14003	Twilight	123	“ What other kingdoms are there ? ”
14006	14020	14021	14021	Gylfie	125	“ Plant kingdom — I heard my father speak of the plant kingdom , ”
14024	14036	14038	14038	Digger	126	“ They do look kind of planty . Do n’t they ? ”
14040	14048	14050	14050	Soren	122	“ What do you mean ? Planty ? ”
14052	14077	14003	14003	Twilight	123	“ I know what Digger ’s talking about . That bright orange thing growing from the middle of its , I guess , face ? ”
14078	14089	14090	14091	the creature	536	“ What do you mean — you guess , face ? ”
14094	14119	14090	14091	the creature	536	“ I mean , we ’re pretty dumb , but you must be dumber if you ca n’t tell a face from a plant . ”
14120	14141	14142	14142	Digger	126	“ Well , you look a bit like a cactus in bloom — the kind we have in the desert , ”
14145	14181	14090	14091	the creature	536	“ That ’s my beak , idiot . I can assure you that neither I nor anyone in my family is a cactus in bloom — whatever a cactus is and whatever a desert is . ”
14182	14189	14090	14091	the creature	536	“ Well , what are you ? ”
14196	14208	14209	14210	the creature	536	“ Well , what in the name of ice are you ? ”
14213	14235	14090	14091	the creature	536	“ I ’m a snake … a nest - maid snake . I serve these most noble of birds , owls . ”
14236	14239	14090	14091	the creature	536	“ Well , ”
14249	14258	14090	14091	the creature	536	“ we ’re just a bunch of puffins . ”
14259	14262	14263	14263	Twilight	123	“ Puffins ! ”
14266	14276	14263	14263	Twilight	123	“ Puffins are northern birds , far northern birds . ”
14277	14280	14284	14286	the little ones	538	“ Duh ! ”
14288	14301	14284	14286	the little ones	538	“ Gee , Pop , I ’m feeling smarter all the time . ”
14302	14309	14310	14310	Gylfie	125	“ But if you ’re puffins , ”
14313	14321	14310	14310	Gylfie	125	“ we must be in the North . ”
14322	14327	14329	14332	one of the puffins	539	“ Ta - da ! ”
14334	14345	14329	14332	one of the puffins	539	“ Gee , you owls are getting smarter every minute ! ”
14346	14361	14284	14286	the little ones	538	“ Does she get a prize , Mummy , for answering the question right ? ”
14386	14399	14310	14310	Gylfie	125	“ Oh , we ’re just having fun with them , Dumpy . ”
14400	14410	14411	14411	Soren	122	“ But how did we get so far north ? ”
14414	14422	14424	14425	the female	325	“ Must have gotten blown off course , ”
14427	14433	14424	14425	the female	325	“ Where you come from ? ”
14434	14438	14439	14439	Twilight	123	“ The Beaks , ”
14442	14447	14424	14425	the female	325	“ Where you headed ? ”
14448	14457	14424	14425	the female	325	“ The island in the Sea of Hoolemere . ”
14458	14475	14424	14425	the female	325	“ Great Ice ! You ’ve passed it by . Overshot it by five hundred leagues . ”
14476	14490	14491	14491	Digger	126	“ What ! We flew over it and did n’t even see it ? ”
14499	14505	14506	14506	Gylfie	125	“ Where are we exactly ? ”
14509	14528	14494	14494	his	126	“ You ’re in the Ice Narrows , far side of Hoolemere , edge of the Northern Kingdoms . ”
14529	14532	14533	14535	All four owls	542	“ What ! ”
14538	14545	14546	14547	the male	326	“ Do n’t feel too dumb , ”
14550	14555	14546	14547	the male	326	“ Bad weather conditions . ”
14556	14567	14568	14569	his mate	323	“ When do we ever have good ones , dear ? ”
14572	14600	14494	14494	his	126	“ Well , true . But with the wind coming from that direction , they just got sucked up into the Narrows and then that williwaw came . ”
14601	14607	14608	14608	Soren	122	“ What ’s a williwaw ? ”
14611	14634	14494	14494	his	126	“ You get a big tumble , like an avalanche . Suppose you do n’t know what that is — an avalanche . ”
14635	14643	14644	14644	Digger	126	“ No , what ’s an avalanche ? ”
14647	14696	14644	14644	Digger	126	“ You know , a big snow slide , but it ’s not snow in a williwaw . Just cold icy air comes over the wall and crashes down . That ’s what sucked you up into the Narrows and slammed you into our wall — our home . ”
14697	14702	14703	14703	Twilight	123	“ This is home ? ”
14706	14718	14719	14720	the male	326	“ Yes , sir . Only one we ’ve ever known , ”
14723	14730	14703	14703	Twilight	123	“ But where do you live ? ”
14731	14763	14764	14764	he	326	“ In the ice cracks and some rocky holes . The wall is not all ice . Plenty of boulders . There are places if you know how to find them , ”
14773	14794	14764	14764	he	326	“ Another storm is coming in from the south . We ’d better get you owls inside . Follow us . ”
14807	14813	14814	14814	Gylfie	125	“ What ’s that smell ? ”
14817	14821	14826	14826	they	548	“ What smell ? ”
14830	14834	14835	14835	Digger	126	“ That smell ! ”
14838	14842	14843	14844	the male	326	“ Probably fish , ”
14847	14854	14843	14844	the male	326	“ Fish ! You eat fish ? ”
14855	14866	14835	14835	Digger	126	“ Not much else . Better get used to it . ”
14867	14878	14879	14880	the female	325	“ And I ’m going fishing before that storm comes , ”
15095	15098	15099	15099	Gylfie	125	“ Sir , ”
15102	15129	15099	15099	Gylfie	125	“ I think something might have happened to your mate … uh … er … She dove into the sea and no sign of her yet . ”
15130	15145	15180	15180	Gylfie	125	“ Oh , she ’ll be a while . Lot of mouths to feed . ”
15170	15179	15180	15180	Gylfie	125	“ There she is ! There she is ! ”
15183	15188	15189	15189	Dumpy	165	“ Good old Ma , ”
15192	15223	15189	15189	Dumpy	165	“ Hope she brought some capelin . I just love capelin . If you do n’t like it , will you give me yours ? Please , please , please ? ”
15224	15227	15228	15228	Soren	122	“ Sure , ”
15246	15251	15252	15252	Twilight	123	“ Look at that , ”
15255	15264	15252	15252	Twilight	123	“ How ’s she going to get off ? ”
15301	15360	15298	15298	her	325	“ Water takeoff — not easy for any of us . We ’re not the best fliers , but , as you can see , we can dive . Got these little air pockets so we can go really deep for a long , long time . Getting back to the nest is the hardest part for us . ”
15373	15390	15361	15362	The male	326	“ Dearest , try that patch over there under the lee , the water is smoother . ”
15409	15457	15391	15391	She	325	“ You want me to fly directly into the wall , Puff Head ! There ’s a tailwind . I ’ll slam beak - first into it . Then where will your dinner be ? If you ’re so smart you come down and go fishing yourself . ”
15458	15468	15470	15470	he	326	“ Oh , sorry , dear , silly me . ”
15476	15506	15470	15470	he	326	“ We ’re really not that bright . I mean we dive well , know how to fish , and deal with ice , but that ’s about it . ”
15524	15531	15532	15532	Gylfie	125	“ Just low self - esteem , ”
15584	15590	15592	15594	the male puffin	565	“ You see , young’uns , ”
15596	15665	15666	15666	He	326	“ nine days out often , the wind slams full force up these Ice Narrows . That ’s how you got sucked into here in the first place . But on the tenth day , it can turn around and suck you right back out . Nice high stream coming through that could pull you right back to The Beaks , if you want to go that far . ”
15751	15758	15759	15759	Soren	122	“ So when should we leave ? ”
15762	15822	15759	15759	Soren	122	“ I think since you owls like night flying you should go tonight . Just when it ’s getting dark is when the wind will begin to turn . It ’ll be easy flying out of here , and then when the wind finally gets behind your tail feathers , you ’ll really go , straight out to Hoolemere . ”
15823	15828	15829	15829	Gylfie	125	“ But the blizzard ? ”
15832	15840	15829	15829	Gylfie	125	“ When will that start up again ? ”
15841	15853	15897	15899	the female puffin	570	“ Not before tomorrow , I think , at the earliest . ”
15854	15863	15864	15864	Soren	122	“ We should all get some rest now , ”
15867	15876	15864	15864	Soren	122	“ If we ’re going to fly tonight . ”
15877	15881	15882	15883	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Good idea , ”
15886	15896	15897	15899	the female puffin	570	“ Better go to the back of the hollow , ”
15902	15927	15897	15899	the female puffin	570	“ Sun ’s coming out and it reflects so brightly off the ice you wo n’t be able to shut your eyes against it . ”
16106	16114	16117	16119	the male puffin	565	“ Time to get up , young’uns . ”
16134	16152	16117	16119	the male puffin	565	“ Wind died down . You can fly out of here now . The wall ’s weeping . ”
16153	16156	16157	16157	Soren	122	“ Huh ? ”
16160	16170	16157	16157	Soren	122	“ What do you mean the wall ’s weeping ? ”
16171	16189	16117	16119	the male puffin	565	“ The ice is melting . Means warm air , the thermals have come . Easy flying . ”
16239	16242	16243	16244	his father	580	“ Dumpy , ”
16247	16286	16243	16244	his father	580	“ Come over here , son . I want you to step up here and watch the young’uns fly . They are the masters of silent flight . Never going to hear a wing flap with these owls ! ”
16342	16353	16335	16335	Twilight	123	“ Soren , the three of us have been thinking . ”
16354	16357	16335	16335	Twilight	123	“ Yes ? ”
16358	16418	16335	16335	Twilight	123	“ Thinking about The Beaks and the Mirror Lakes . We ’ve been thinking , why not go back there for just a little while ? You know , just to kind of rest up , get this fish out of our system . Eat us some nice fat voles , then go on to the Great Ga’Hoole Tree . ”
16439	16444	16445	16445	Soren	122	“ I … I … ”
16448	16456	16445	16445	Soren	122	“ I think there ’s a problem . ”
16457	16463	16464	16464	Twilight	123	“ What ’s the problem ? ”
16467	16490	16491	16491	Soren	122	“ I think that if we go there , we wo n’t go on — ever — to the Great Ga’Hoole Tree , ”
16497	16534	16494	16494	Twilight	123	“ Well , what if some of us think — you know , kind of differently ? Would that be wrong of us to go ? I mean , you ’d be free to go on . ”
16707	16740	16704	16704	Twilight	123	“ I mean , Soren , as I said , you could go on if you wanted . What would be wrong with each of us doing what we want to do ? ”
16747	16754	16755	16755	he	122	“ Because we are a band , ”
17292	17307	17308	17308	Digger	126	“ I do n’t know how we ’ll ever see this Island of Hoole , ”
17311	17320	17308	17308	Digger	126	“ Look down . Everything is turning white . ”
17321	17327	17329	17329	Gylfie	125	“ Where ’s the current ? ”
17585	17601	17602	17602	Twilight	123	“ Let me fly point , Twilight . I ’ll be able to hear better . ”
17612	17630	17602	17602	Twilight	123	“ Hang on , Mrs. P. , I ’m going to have to do some head rolls . ”
17705	17708	17710	17710	Soren	122	“ Hello ! ”
17729	17733	17712	17713	Mrs. P.	128	“ Just scanning . ”
17761	17772	17748	17748	He	122	“ Digger , remember that coyote song you were singing ? ”
17773	17776	17712	17713	Mrs. P.	128	“ Yes . ”
17777	17787	17748	17748	He	122	“ Sing it again and tip your head down . ”
17788	17798	17712	17713	Mrs. P.	128	“ Hard to tell which way is down tonight . ”
17850	17859	17847	17847	he	122	“ I think we ’re still over water . ”
17928	17941	17925	17925	Twilight	123	“ It ’s time for me to fly point again , Soren . ”
18122	18146	18147	18147	Soren	122	“ I ca n’t believe that a current can just disappear . The puffins said it would lead us right to the island , ”
18150	18156	18157	18157	Twilight	123	“ What do they know ? ”
18160	18168	18157	18157	Twilight	123	“ They even admit they ’re dumb . ”
18169	18180	18181	18181	Soren	122	“ I do n’t think they ’re all that dumb , ”
18184	18195	18181	18181	Soren	122	“ We ’ve got to be able to find it . ”
18196	18211	18212	18212	Gylfie	125	“ And there ’s no place to even fetch up out here and rest , ”
18215	18222	18223	18223	Twilight	123	“ We got to go back , ”
18226	18236	18237	18237	Soren	122	“ Go back where ? Not to The Beaks , ”
18241	18260	18261	18261	Twilight	123	“ To any dry land . If The Beaks is the closest , then The Beaks it is , ”
18264	18267	18268	18268	Soren	122	“ No ! ”
18273	18287	18268	18268	Soren	122	“ Look , I ’m going to fly down close to the water . ”
18288	18294	18295	18295	Digger	126	“ That could be dangerous , ”
18298	18341	18295	18295	Digger	126	“ Soren , that wind is kicking up big waves . You could be caught by one , and believe me , I do n’t think that you ’re the swimmer that the puffin was . You could be dragged right under . ”
18342	18362	18268	18268	Soren	122	“ I ’ll be careful . Mrs. P. , if you want to slither onto Twilight , you can . ”
18363	18379	18295	18295	Digger	126	“ No , dear , I ’ll stick with you . I ’m not frightened . ”
18380	18383	18268	18268	Soren	122	“ Good . ”
18508	18514	18482	18482	He	122	“ Right here , Soren . ”
18515	18523	18482	18482	He	122	“ Twilight ! You followed me down . ”
18524	18530	18531	18531	Twilight	123	“ Call me a fool . ”
18573	18606	18482	18482	He	122	“ Come , young’uns . You ’re right over the current . Ca n’t tell it on a night like this , though . So , welcome to the Island of Hoole . ”
18630	18642	18607	18610	Two giant Snowy Owls	170	“ I am Boron and this is my mate , Barran . ”
18643	18654	18655	18655	Twilight	123	“ You are the king and the queen of Hoole . ”
18669	18695	18697	18697	Barran	172	“ Yes , my dears . But we prefer to be called teachers , or rybs . The word ryb means teacher and deep knowledge , ”
18699	18707	18709	18709	Boron	171	“ We ’re not keen on titles , ”
18711	18720	18722	18722	Soren	122	“ But you came out to meet us ? ”
18724	18728	18730	18730	Boron	171	“ Of course , ”
18732	18756	18730	18730	Boron	171	“ You ’ve done the hard part . Now let us guide you the rest of the way . It ’s not far . ”
18845	18857	18858	18858	Soren	122	“ We are here , Mrs. Plithiver . We are here ! ”
18861	18875	18858	18858	Soren	122	“ I know , dear . I feel it . I feel it ! ”
18982	19035	18971	18971	Boron	171	“ I see you have noticed our candles . You see , here in Hoole we have discovered how to capture fire and tame it for our own uses . You shall learn all about this , young ones . And who knows ? One of you might even become a collier . ”
19036	19040	19042	19042	Soren	122	“ A what ? ”
19044	19093	18971	18971	Boron	171	“ A collier — a carrier of coals . It is a very special skill . But there are many skills you shall be able to learn here in the Great Ga’Hoole Tree , and we are all here to teach you . These shall be your rybs . ”
19211	19229	19208	19208	Barran	172	“ Welcome , young ones . Welcome to the Great Ga’Hoole Tree . One journey has ended … ”
19259	19268	19253	19253	Barran	172	“ Chaws — back up to your positions ! ”
19318	19333	19334	19334	Twilight	123	“ Great Glaux — a battle ! Quick , let ’s get our claws ! ”
19346	19353	19354	19360	A plump , Short - eared Owl	642	“ Not so fast , young’un . ”
19366	19373	19374	19374	Twilight	123	“ But where ’s the battle ? ”
19377	19382	19383	19387	The Short - eared Owl	173	“ Beyond the Beyond . ”
19398	19408	19409	19409	she	173	“ And it ’s not for you or you , ”
19416	19422	19423	19423	She	173	“ or you or you . ”
19432	19438	19439	19439	She	173	“ And who are you ? ”
19444	19458	19442	19443	Mrs. P.	128	“ Mrs. Horace Plithiver , nest - maid . I do have references . ”
19459	19470	19442	19443	Mrs. P.	128	“ I see . Come along , all of you . ”
19471	19478	19479	19479	Twilight	123	“ But what about the battle ? ”
19482	19504	19479	19479	Twilight	123	“ What about it ? Not much really , just a skirmish on the borderlands between Silverveil and Beyond the Beyond . ”
19773	19804	19805	19805	They	645	“ Now , I want you young’uns to stay out of the way . We ’ve got some wounded owls coming in and I have to arrange for their care . ”
19827	19856	19857	19861	Another Short - eared Owl	653	“ Matron , we ’re going to need moss and down . Search - and - rescue ’s coming in with two more little ones . Nest decimation . ”
19874	19883	19871	19871	her	653	“ Oh , no ! Poor little things . ”
19884	19892	19893	19893	Soren	122	“ Nest decimation . What ’s that ? ”
19896	19902	19903	19906	A young Spotted Owl	654	“ Accidental destruction of nests . ”
19920	19940	19903	19906	A young Spotted Owl	654	“ Otulissa , thank goodness . Can you show these new arrivals to that hollow we cleaned out yesterday ? ”
19941	19946	19903	19906	A young Spotted Owl	654	“ Certainly , Matron . ”
19947	19965	19903	19906	A young Spotted Owl	654	“ And see if Cook has any tea or cakes left over . They look half starved . ”
19966	19969	19903	19906	A young Spotted Owl	654	“ Certainly . ”
19981	19988	19989	19989	Twilight	123	“ What is going on here ? ”
19993	20010	19903	19906	A young Spotted Owl	654	“ Oh , there ’ve been some skirmishes up in the borderlands , nothing too serious . ”
20011	20018	20019	20019	Soren	122	“ Is it St. Aggie ’s ? ”
20022	20036	20019	20019	Soren	122	“ We know all about St. Aggie ’s . Gylfie and I escaped . ”
20040	20062	20063	20063	Twilight	123	“ And we killed their top two lieutenants when they came after Digger here . So we ’re ready to fight , ”
20072	20092	20066	20068	The Spotted Owl	178	“ I mean , we ’re in the right place , are n’t we ? The Great Ga’Hoole Tree ? ”
20105	20120	20121	20121	Soren	122	“ Where each night the order of knightly owls rises to perform noble deeds , ”
20152	20158	20159	20159	his	122	“ This is the place ? ”
20163	20171	20172	20174	the Spotted Owl	658	“ Of course it ’s the place , ”
20177	20188	20189	20189	Twilight	123	“ Then get us some battle claws — we’re ready ! ”
20195	20200	20201	20201	Otulissa	176	“ You ’re ready ! ”
20204	20221	20201	20201	Otulissa	176	“ You think just because you escaped and killed two rattlebrained owls , you ’re ready ? ”
20222	20227	20228	20228	Soren	122	“ And the bobcat , ”
20231	20236	20237	20237	Digger	126	“ And the crows , ”
20241	20254	20237	20237	Digger	126	“ Well , not exactly killed them , but drove them off . ”
20275	20294	20269	20271	the Elf Owl	529	“ Are you trying to tell us we are not ready … that … that it takes more ? ”
20295	20312	20313	20315	The Spotted Owl	178	“ Indeed . There is nothing that noble about slaughtering two bad owls in the desert . ”
20338	20391	20335	20335	she	178	“ You have not been tempered by battle yet . Nor do you know the first thing about strategy . You probably do n’t even know how to fly with battle claws . I have been here much longer than you and still have not yet become a member of a chaw . ”
20392	20398	20399	20399	Soren	122	“ What ’s a chaw ? ”
20402	20427	20335	20335	she	178	“ You are selected to join a chaw — a small team of owls — and you will learn a skill that is helpful . ”
20428	20432	20433	20433	Twilight	123	“ In battle ? ”
20436	20518	20520	20522	the Spotted Owl	658	“ Not just battle — in life . There is more to life than just battles . Each chaw has its own , oh , how should I put it ? Personality . Navigation chaw tends to have a kind of elegance , they are all superb flyers , as are the members of search - and - rescue , but they , of course , are less refined . Weather interpretation and colliering are decidely rough and uncouth . But , ”
20531	20546	20529	20529	Twilight	123	“ they are all fiercely brave and can fight or fly to the death ! ”
20588	20600	20601	20601	Soren	122	“ Do we all get to be in the same chaw ? ”
20604	20608	20626	20626	he	122	“ Probably not . ”
20609	20616	20620	20620	he	122	“ But we ’re a band . ”
20630	20650	20626	20626	he	122	“ That does n’t matter now . You ’re part of a larger band . I have to go . ”
20651	20658	20666	20666	her	125	“ Duty calls , I suppose , ”
20669	20675	20666	20666	her	125	“ I suppose it does . ”
20701	20710	20711	20711	Twilight	123	“ I do n’t like her one bit , ”
20714	20753	20754	20754	Gylfie	125	“ Me , neither . Did you see how she looked at me ? She might think she ’s all hoity - toity and very refined , but I bet she makes tasteless stature jokes all the time . ”
20797	20804	20812	20816	two burly Great Horned Owls	159	“ Make way ! Make way ! ”
20878	20883	20869	20872	a young crying owl	672	“ There , there . ”
21013	21027	20994	20994	She	680	“ Now , now , dear , we know you did your best . ”
21028	21037	20994	20994	She	680	“ But what will Mum and Da think ? ”
21055	21068	21069	21069	Matron	175	“ They will think that you were a brave little Pygmy Owl , ”
21075	21096	21097	21097	Matron	175	“ What are you doing out there ? Just do n’t stand around , come in and make yourself useful , ”
21135	21147	21148	21148	Matron	175	“ Now what did you say your name was , dear ? ”
21155	21158	21148	21148	Matron	175	“ Primrose . ”
21159	21168	21148	21148	Matron	175	“ Yes . Primrose here lost her nest . ”
21169	21174	21176	21178	the little owl	685	“ The whole tree , ”
21180	21209	21148	21148	Matron	175	“ Yes , indeed . See , her parents had gone off to fight in the borderlands skirmishes , and they had left her all safe and sound . ”
21210	21240	21148	21148	Matron	175	“ I was supposed to be sitting the two new eggs . Mum was really only off hunting , not fighting . She was going to be right back . ”
21241	21245	21246	21246	Soren	122	“ What happened ? ”
21249	21299	21302	21302	she	685	“ A fire — forest fire . I did n’t think it would reach our tree and when it did , well , I tried to save one of the eggs . But you know , I have n’t been flying that long and , well , I just … ”
21317	21322	21313	21313	her	685	“ Any tea here ? ”
21323	21339	21402	21402	she	685	“ Oh , yes , I think a cup of milkberry tea would be lovely . ”
21340	21353	21313	21313	her	685	“ I dropped the egg . I do n’t deserve to live . ”
21367	21373	21374	21374	Soren	122	“ Do n’t say that ! ”
21377	21398	21374	21374	Soren	122	“ Of course you deserve to live . Every owl deserves to live . That ’s why we came here . ”
21518	21552	21506	21506	she	181	“ But what about Mum ? What about Da ? What will they think when they come home and find our forest burned , our tree gone ? Will they look for me ? ”
21639	21660	21661	21661	she	181	“ Ah , one of the new arrivals , part of that band that flew in from the Ice Narrows , ”
21665	21693	21661	21661	she	181	“ Yes , well , we do n’t come from the Narrows . We were blown off course . We ’d left from The Beaks but somehow … ”
21694	21710	21717	21717	she	181	“ Oh , dear … Yes , The Beaks , only for the strongest gizzards . ”
21722	21795	21717	21717	she	181	“ I ’m Strix Struma , here . Perhaps you need to sharpen your navigational skills . I am the navigation ryb . It ’s getting to be First Light , so I suggest you hasten to your hollow . And if you are very quiet , you shall hear the music of Madame Plonk ’s harp . It is lovely to go to sleep to and she has a fine voice . ”
21796	21806	21807	21807	Soren	122	“ What ’s a harp ? What ’s music ? ”
21826	21845	21807	21807	Soren	122	“ Oh , dear . It ’s hard to explain . Listen and you ’ll begin to know . ”
21863	21870	21871	21871	Gylfie	125	“ It ’s amazing , Soren , ”
21874	21887	21871	21871	Gylfie	125	“ Nest - maid snakes brought the tea around on their backs . ”
21888	21911	21912	21913	Mrs. P.	128	“ Yes , I really think there will be a place for me here , Soren . I think I can serve . ”
21930	21967	21968	21968	Twilight	123	“ I did n’t kill those two fiends of St. Aggie ’s , I did n’t battle crows and tear out the throat of a bobcat to sit on my tail feathers and be served tea . ”
21977	21987	21988	21988	Gylfie	125	“ Well , what can you do , Twilight ? ”
21991	22069	22070	22070	He	123	“ I think we have to have a word with the head owls — Boron and Barran . I do n’t think they know what real evil is . This border skirmish up there that they are talking about — it has nothing to do with St. Aggie ’s . You heard what little Miss Stuck - up Spotted Owl said . I do n’t think they know what they ’re in for . But we do ! ”
22079	22082	22070	22070	He	123	“ Right ? ”
22083	22093	22094	22094	Digger	126	“ You mean the ‘ You only wish ’ ? ”
22146	22149	22150	22150	Soren	122	“ Yes , ”
22154	22178	22150	22150	Soren	122	“ Maybe we should go talk to the king and queen . But not now . It ’s daylight . Time to sleep . ”
22251	22255	22256	22256	Soren	122	“ This down , ”
22262	22268	22256	22256	Soren	122	“ reminds me of Mum . ”
22269	22278	22280	22281	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Oh , does n’t it , dear ! ”
22430	22440	22441	22441	Twilight	123	“ Digger , Soren , Gylf , you asleep ? ”
22444	22449	22450	22450	Digger	126	“ Almost , Twi , ”
22455	22468	22450	22450	Digger	126	“ How soon do you think until we get our battle claws ? ”
22469	22485	22486	22486	Soren	122	“ I have no idea , Twilight . But do n’t worry , good light , ”
22490	22496	22497	22497	Digger	126	“ Good light , Twi , ”
22500	22506	22507	22507	Gylfie	125	“ Good light , Soren , ”
22510	22516	22517	22517	Soren	122	“ Good light , Gylf , ”
22524	22531	22517	22517	Soren	122	“ Good light , Mrs. Plithiver . ”
22574	22582	22583	22586	an owl on guard	707	“ Very important business inside , young’uns , ”
22597	22604	22605	22605	Gylfie	125	“ We wo n’t take long , ”
22640	22655	22636	22636	her	710	“ You can come in now . But be quiet and wait your turn . ”
22851	22863	22864	22866	Gyl - fie	189	“ I ’ve never seen a more disreputable - looking owl , ”
22869	22881	22882	22882	She	187	“ Great Glaux , look at his foot ! His talons ! ”
22885	22890	22882	22882	She	187	“ Or lack of ! ”
22947	22952	22953	22953	Boron	171	“ So , Elvanryb , ”
22964	22987	22960	22962	a Great Gray	159	“ It is your notion that we need to have a search - and - rescue attachment chaw on the colliering missions ? ”
22988	23101	23129	23131	the Whiskered Screech	188	“ Not all , Boron . I think they are only necessary when we are in areas near battle zones . So often the parents are off fighting . In normal circumstances , the parents are there if a fire breaks out , but tonight , for instance , we had to pick up that little Pygmy and a Northern Saw - whet . We got them back , but it taxed our chaw , believe me — carrying coals and injured owlets . Ca n’t exactly drop them in the coal bucket . And I do n’t even like to think of the ones we might have missed and left behind . ”
23111	23116	23117	23117	Boron	171	“ Yes , Ezylryb ? ”
23123	23128	23129	23131	the Whiskered Screech	188	“ Question for Bubo . ”
23139	23154	23129	23131	the Whiskered Screech	188	“ You think this fire was natural or more trouble with the rogue raids ? ”
23155	23181	23129	23131	the Whiskered Screech	188	“ No telling , sir . The rogues make good targets , and it would n’t be the first time raiding one caused a fire . ”
23182	23185	23186	23188	the Whiskered Screech	717	“ Hmmm , ”
23208	23214	23215	23215	Boron	171	“ Next order of business , ”
23218	23225	23215	23215	Boron	171	“ Something about starvation in Ambala ? ”
23411	23414	23415	23416	another owl	710	“ Yes , ”
23421	23448	23415	23416	another owl	710	“ The egg production is down , and it is thought to be caused by a blight on the rodent population . Simply not enough food . ”
23491	23498	23499	23499	Boron	171	“ We ’ll look into it , ”
23502	23520	23521	23521	He	122	“ And now , I believe some of our new arrivals have requested to speak with us . ”
23554	23562	23537	23537	he	122	“ Now who wants to go first ? ”
23574	23580	23563	23563	Twilight	123	“ Up here , young’un . ”
23690	23709	23710	23710	He	122	“ Uh … my name is Soren . I am from the Forest of Tyto . I er … ”
23752	23766	23767	23767	Gylfie	125	“ Tales of attempted fratricide might not be the right way to start , ”
23827	23849	23818	23818	Kludd	129	“ I was snatched by a St. Aggie ’s patrol . It was at St. Aggie ’s that I met Gylfie . ”
23911	23915	23916	23916	Barran	172	“ And so ? ”
23925	23930	23931	23931	Soren	122	“ And so what ? ”
23934	23943	23916	23916	Barran	172	“ What is it you want , dear ? ”
23944	24007	24008	24008	He	122	“ The four of us are a band . We have flown together , fought together , and escaped many dangers — as a band . We know from our experience that there is great evil that threatens every owl in every owl kingdom on earth . We want only to fight this evil , to become guardian knights of this order . ”
24027	24042	24043	24043	Soren	122	“ We feel that we have special knowledge . We have much to offer , ”
24046	24053	24055	24055	Boron	171	“ I am sure you do , ”
24057	24109	24110	24110	He	122	“ Every owl here has special knowledge and , during your training , you will find out what your talents are . You will , after proper instruction , be chosen for a chaw and then your learning will , indeed , advance to a higher level , become more specialized . ”
24131	24166	24110	24110	He	122	“ We do not all need to learn the same things . Each of you will make your band better in the end if you learn different skills . And this all takes time . ”
24317	24442	24312	24312	Boron	171	“ It takes time , of which I think you have an abundance . It takes patience — and that , I am not sure how much you have and , most important , it takes dedication and that , young’un , is found both in the heart and the gizzard . The nobility of the owls you see here in the parliament has not simply been given , nor has it been earned through courageous acts . Indeed , nobility is not always found in the flash of battle claws or flying through the embered wakes of firestorms , or even in making strong the weak , mending the broken , vanquishing the proud , or making powerless those who abuse the frail . ”
24452	24540	24449	24449	Boron	171	“ It is also found in the resolute heart , the gizzard that can withstand the temptations of false dreams , the mind that has the imagination to comprehend another ’s pain , as I think one young owl did tonight when he sat by the little Pygmy Owl with quiet understanding of her loss of tree , nest , family , and egg . It is all of this that ultimately confers nobility and makes the Guardians of Ga’Hoole rise in the night with hearts sublime . ”
24551	24581	24541	24541	Boron	171	“ And so as I said when you arrived , one journey has ended and now another starts . On the night of the morrow your training shall begin . ”
24881	24889	24890	24890	Soren	122	“ What are you doing , Twilight ? ”
24894	24897	24890	24890	Soren	122	“ Thinking . ”
24938	24943	24944	24944	Twilight	123	“ Thinking of leaving , ”
24953	24956	24957	24957	Soren	122	“ Leaving ? ”
24961	24970	24957	24957	Soren	122	“ But we ’re a band , Twilight . ”
24971	24987	24957	24957	Soren	122	“ We ’re not a band , Soren . Boron and Barran said as much . ”
24988	25002	24957	24957	Soren	122	“ They did n’t exactly say we ’re not a band , Twilight . ”
25003	25049	24957	24957	Soren	122	“ I think that is exactly what they meant . They said it was highly unlikely that any of us would be chosen for the same chaw . They said it was not the Ga’Hoolian way . In other words , they are separating us . ”
25050	25102	24957	24957	Soren	122	“ They are separating us only for the chaws and that ’s because they want us all to learn different things . That does n’t mean we ’re not a band . A band is n’t just perching side by side , or even flying side by side all the time . ”
25106	25115	25103	25103	Twilight	123	“ Well , what is it , then ? ”
25152	25208	25145	25145	he	122	“ We are a band despite what any owl says or does . In our gizzards , we are a band and we feel that . It can not be undone . We are what we are and I know it and you know it and we all know it — even they know it . ”
25250	25272	25246	25246	Twilight	123	“ I am an owl of low birth in the eyes of the world because I have had no proper upbringing . ”
25297	25326	25292	25292	he	123	“ I have had no First Ceremonies , no First Insect , no First Fur - on - Meat ceremony . There is much I do n’t know . ”
25339	25520	25331	25331	Twilight	123	“ But there is much I do know . I know light and shadow and everything in between . I know the life pulse in the throat of a bobcat and where to slash to break the blood pump that is the cat ’s heart . I know mountains and deserts and the creatures who fly and those who do n’t , but slither or crawl or leap . I know of all sorts of claws , as well as fangs and poisons that lock the talons and freeze the wings . I know the false horizon that comes in the heat of the summer when the air is thick with dew and confuses old owls so that they go yeep and fall . And I know all this , not because I was reared in a hollow lined with the down of my mother ’s breast , but because I was not . I was alone within minutes of my hatching . I can be alone . It is a special talent . And I can be alone again . ”
25537	25580	25529	25529	Twilight	123	“ But I also know that I am a better owl with you and with Gylfie and Digger . I know now that I am part of a band . And I know this because of you , Soren — you alone . ”
25615	25641	25642	25642	Soren	122	“ Perhaps , Soren , you are the blood pump of the band , and I would not want to slash such a life pulse . ”
25645	25671	25642	25642	Soren	122	“ You are right , Soren . We are a band . And nothing can or will undo it . We are our own guardians . ”
25672	25684	25685	25685	Soren	122	“ And maybe someday we shall become the Guardians of Ga’Hoole , ”
26161	26172	26173	26174	Strix Struma	187	“ We shall begin with a few simple tracing exercises , ”
26192	26200	26201	26201	she	187	“ The Great Glaux will soon rise , ”
26204	26257	26258	26258	She	187	“ The time of the Little Raccoon has , of course , passed by this season but a new beauty shall appear for the first time tonight . The Golden Talons . It is an unusual constellation , for in this part of the world it shall be with us through summer . ”
26266	26289	26258	26258	She	187	“ And just like our talons , there are four — long , curved , and sharp ones formed by the stars . ”
26290	26295	26298	26298	Primrose	181	“ But not gold , ”
26323	26333	26334	26335	Strix Struma	187	“ The gold is an illusion , my dear , ”
26338	26352	26334	26335	Strix Struma	187	“ It is caused by atmospheric wobble that you shall learn more about . ”
26380	26388	26389	26389	she	187	“ A little snack before we fly , ”
26407	26440	26389	26389	she	187	“ We do n’t want to overeat before our lesson . That is never good , but a bit of bat gives a boost , I always find . Now , ready ! ”
26441	26447	26448	26448	they	774	“ Yes , Strix Struma , ”
26490	26549	26485	26485	she	187	“ Good , then . Primrose , I would like you flying directly behind me . Otulissa , seeing as you have had navigation class before , I think I shall put you on my windward flank . Gylfie , you shall fly in the downwind flanking position . And Soren , you fly tail . Any questions ? ”
26569	26572	26602	26603	Strix Struma	187	“ Any questions ”
26594	26597	26584	26585	Strix Struma	187	“ flanks . ”
26636	26643	26645	26648	the large Spotted Owl	777	“ Off we go , then ! ”
26744	26750	26751	26752	Strix Struma	187	“ All right , class . ”
26778	26796	26751	26752	Strix Struma	187	“ Two points off to windward . Please note the first star of the Golden Talons rising . ”
26797	26805	26808	26808	Otulissa	176	“ Ooooh , this is sooooo exciting . ”
26863	26888	26838	26838	she	176	“ And it ’s such an honor to be flying windward flank , Strix Struma , in the grand tradition of your noble family . ”
26939	26945	26935	26935	she	156	“ Do you believe her ? ”
26950	26964	26946	26946	Primrose	181	“ Do you have a cold , Otulissa ? You sound clogged up . ”
27001	27004	26994	26994	Primrose	181	“ Guileless , ”
27009	27013	27005	27005	Gylfie	125	“ Charmingly guileless . ”
27126	27141	27143	27144	Strix Struma	187	“ We shall trace each talon from its toe base to its sharp tip , ”
27197	27206	27207	27208	Strix Struma	187	“ Confusing , is n’t it , dear ? ”
27213	27229	27207	27208	Strix Struma	187	“ You ’re in a difficult position behind Primrose , but it ’s good training . ”
27230	27235	27238	27238	her	181	“ Oh , Soren . ”
27241	27257	27238	27238	her	181	“ It ’s my darned spots , is n’t it ? I ’m so embarrassed . ”
27258	27263	27264	27265	Strix Struma	187	“ Nonsense , child ! ”
27268	27333	27264	27265	Strix Struma	187	“ Do n’t you ever belittle those spots . You ’ll see , they ’ll come in handy someday . We must learn to use our Glaux - given gifts and in that way they truly become not just gifts but treasures . Now you fly on . You ’re doing a nice job and I shall teach Soren some tricks to reduce his disorientation .
27334	27372	27238	27238	her	181	“ I had to fly behind a Pygmy for years . Made me a terrific navigator . Now , what you do , Soren , is you focus just below the spots . That will help you . ”
27635	27689	27619	27619	Twilight	123	“ I did a fantastic power dive tonight . A tight spiral and I was down on the ground before you could flick a blink . Soren , I think Barran was really impressed . So you think there ’s a chance that she might recommend me for search - and - rescue ? ”
27690	27716	27619	27619	Twilight	123	“ But , Twilight , if you were in the advanced navigation class with Barran why were you practicing search - and - rescue moves ? ”
27717	27743	27619	27619	Twilight	123	“ Because Barran also teaches search - and - rescue . She is the one who taps for the search - and - rescue chaw . ”
27765	27818	27761	27761	Otulissa	176	“ Oh , I do n’t know , Twilight , about you getting tapped for search - and - rescue chaw . Do n’t get your hopes up . They tend to take owls with very old family lines . Those ranks are almost always reserved for Strix , just like navigation . ”
27819	27824	27826	27826	Bubo	197	“ Oh , racdrops ! ”
27828	27876	27826	27826	Bubo	197	“ Make way ! Make way ! Let the nest snakes serve tea . We all be starving and do n’t need to listen to none of this nonsense about old family lines . It ’s what you do here and now on this earth that counts . ”
28040	28080	28083	28083	Matron	808	“ Line up ! Line up ! Now , please do n’t rush the dear snakes . Do n’t crowd the snakes by cramming in too many of you around one snake . Please proceed in an orderly fashion . ”
28177	28182	28187	28187	her	128	“ Hello , dearies , ”
28191	28202	28187	28187	her	128	“ Good night in the Yonder ? Classes went well ? ”
28203	28206	28207	28207	Digger	126	“ Look ! ”
28210	28222	28207	28207	Digger	126	“ Primrose over there does n’t have a place to sit . ”
28223	28228	28229	28229	Otulissa	176	“ Sorry , Primrose , ”
28233	28242	28243	28243	Otulissa	176	“ but this snake is all filled up . ”
28252	28258	28259	28259	Gylfie	125	“ Over here , Primrose . ”
28264	28270	28259	28259	Gylfie	125	“ We have a place . ”
28271	28277	28278	28279	Mrs. P.	128	“ Always room , dearie , ”
28286	28302	28282	28282	Primrose	181	“ I can always stretch myself a little longer and fit in another young one . ”
28303	28314	28315	28315	Primrose	181	“ Oh , thank you . Thank you so much , ”
28322	28329	28330	28330	Digger	126	“ You all right , Primrose ? ”
28334	28342	28343	28343	She	128	“ I ’m fine . Just fine . ”
28351	28358	28359	28359	she	128	“ Well , not so fine , ”
28362	28374	28359	28359	she	128	“ All this talk of tapping is really making me nervous . ”
28375	28391	28392	28393	Mrs. P.	128	“ Now , I believe there is entirely too much talk about this tapping business , ”
28396	28450	28392	28393	Mrs. P.	128	“ I think you young ones should just drink your tea while it is still nice and warm . Cook made a special effort with the milkberries . I think she added a few extra as the season shall be coming again soon and perhaps she can spare more for tea without worrying . ”
28451	28464	28465	28465	Soren	122	“ It ’s hard not to think about tapping , Mrs. P. , ”
28468	28476	28465	28465	Soren	122	“ It ’s all anyone talks about . ”
28477	28511	28512	28512	Digger	126	“ They say most Burrowing Owls like myself are tapped for tracking , since we have such strong legs and really know the countryside so well . I think I ’d like that , ”
28516	28533	28534	28534	Twilight	123	“ I want search - and - rescue myself . You get to wear battle claws , ”
28538	28544	28545	28545	Primrose	181	“ You want to fight ? ”
28556	28592	28593	28593	He	126	“ I ’d like to fight any owl from St. Aggie ’s . Let me tell you , we gave those two a run for it that time in the desert . Did n’t we ? ”
28641	28645	28647	28647	Digger	126	“ Thank goodness , ”
28649	28670	28671	28671	Digger	126	“ If it had n’t been for them and , of course , the eagles , I would be dead . ”
28674	28681	28671	28671	Digger	126	“ Not just dead … eaten . ”
28682	28687	28688	28688	Primrose	181	“ You ’re joking ? ”
28691	28697	28698	28698	Digger	126	“ I ’m not joking , ”
28701	28712	28713	28713	Primrose	181	“ Oh , come on , tell me the story , ”
28716	28742	28713	28713	Primrose	181	“ Young ones , I do n’t think this is tea - table talk and since I am the tea table I would prefer not . ”
28769	28774	28762	28763	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Hukla , hukla , ”
28786	28794	28762	28763	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Young owls will be young owls . ”
28812	28836	28837	28837	Twilight	123	“ So here ’s how the joke goes . You got a bunch of crows and other wet poopers like hummingbirds and seagulls . ”
28844	28853	28854	28854	Primrose	181	“ Oh , yes . Seagulls are disgusting , ”
28857	28860	28861	28861	Soren	122	“ Definitely , ”
28865	28870	28861	28861	Soren	122	“ They are disgusting . ”
28871	28888	28889	28889	Digger	126	“ We should have a contest to see who can tell the slimiest wet poop joke , ”
28902	28907	28908	28909	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Enough is enough ! ”
28919	28937	28908	28909	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ I shall not have this talk at the table . This is inappropriate on every level . ”
29083	29087	29088	29088	she	172	“ Poor form , ”
29096	29120	29092	29092	Boron	171	“ Do n’t be too hard on them , dear . They ’re just youngsters . Young males do that kind of thing . ”
29121	29138	29180	29180	Barran	172	“ Boron , I would like to point out that Primrose and Gylfie are not males . ”
29139	29153	29154	29154	Primrose	181	“ Oh , but I still know a lot of wet poop jokes , ”
29207	29219	29220	29221	his mate	323	“ Really ! Boron ! It ’s not a laughing matter , ”
29226	29239	29241	29241	he	825	“ But it is , my dear . That ’s the point . ”
29270	29274	29268	29268	her	183	“ Night Is Done ”
29665	29688	29657	29658	Mrs. P.	128	“ Soren , dear boy , what are you doing up this time of day ? Come on in , young one . ”
29689	29699	29657	29658	Mrs. P.	128	“ Are n’t the other nest - maids asleep ? ”
29700	29713	29657	29658	Mrs. P.	128	“ Oh , no . They ’re all out doing guild business . ”
29767	29791	29756	29757	Mrs. Plithiver	120	“ Mrs. P. , I came to apologize for my disgusting behavior at tea . I am truly sorry . I know that … ”
29808	29811	29812	29812	she	128	“ Soren , ”
29833	29857	29812	29812	she	128	“ Soren , dear boy , I know you are sorry , but I do n’t think that is why you are here . ”
29858	29863	29869	29869	she	128	“ It ’s not ? ”
29899	29904	29905	29905	he	122	“ Why … why , ”
29908	29913	29905	29905	he	122	“ am I here ? ”
29914	29927	29931	29931	she	128	“ I think it has to do with your sister , Eglantine . ”
30001	30026	29984	29984	she	128	“ It ’s the not knowing , is n’t it , that ’s so hard . Not knowing if Eglantine is dead or alive … ”
30027	30031	30032	30032	Soren	122	“ Or imprisoned , ”
30035	30043	29984	29984	she	128	“ Yes , dear . I know . ”
30044	30074	29984	29984	she	128	“ And if she is dead , it does n’t help me one bit to think of her being in glaumora if I am here and she is there . ”
30075	30091	29984	29984	she	128	“ No , of course not . She ’s too young to be in glaumora . ”
30092	30121	29984	29984	she	128	“ Mrs. P. , I know that St. Aegolius Academy for Orphan Owls is the most terrible place . But remember what the dying Barred Owl said about , ”
30127	30135	30124	30124	his	122	“ the ‘ you only wish ’ … ”
30136	30142	30124	30124	his	122	“ Hush now , dear . ”
30150	30164	30148	30148	himself	122	“ Have you heard anything else about the ‘ you only wish ’ ? ”
30225	30240	30220	30220	Soren	122	“ I ’m sorry , Mrs. P. I wo n’t speak of this again . ”
30241	30391	30401	30402	Mrs. P.	128	“ No , dear . Come to me whenever you want to talk about Eglantine . I think it will help you , but let ’s not get carried away about rumors of terrible places . I have a feeling deep within me that Eglantine is not dead . Now , I can not tell you more than that , but I think , together , we can hope . Hope is never a foolish thing — although others will tell you it is . But I do n’t need to tell you that , Soren — look at yourself . You were snatched and you taught yourself to fly and you escaped from that awful St. Aggie ’s . You flew straight out of those deep stone canyons and right into the Yonder . Anyone who flies out of a stone hole into the Yonder knows about hope . ”
30772	30779	30809	30809	She	183	“ Lovely , is n’t it ? ”
30944	31009	30940	30941	Madame Plonk	183	“ Time for me to go , dear . Wake - up time . Evensong must be sung . I see the snakes coming out now , making their way toward the harp . Ca n’t be late . But I ’ve so enjoyed our afternoon flight . We ’ll do it again sometime . Or drop by for a cup of milkberry tea . ”
31020	31022	31023	31024	Madame Plonk	183	just”drop by ”
31139	31151	31128	31128	You	1537	” It was the Ga’Hoolology ryb , a boring old Burrowing Owl .
31152	31157	31128	31128	You	1537	“ Here ’s one . ”
31158	31169	31128	31128	You	1537	“ Oh , yes , Otulissa . A perfect example . ”
31170	31175	31176	31176	Gylfie	125	“ Here ’s one , ”
31180	31188	31178	31178	Otulissa	176	“ She has the most annoying voice . ”
31189	31221	31222	31223	the ryb	869	“ Now if we can find a pellet or if someone would care to yarp one , I shall demonstrate the proper burying technique . Pellets properly buried nourish the tree , ”
31226	31235	31236	31236	Otulissa	176	“ Oh , I ’ll find you one , ”
31243	31251	31253	31253	Soren	122	“ This is the most borrring class , ”
31271	31281	31283	31283	Digger	126	“ I do n’t think it ’s that bad , ”
31299	31317	31318	31318	Twilight	123	“ I do n’t know what I ’ll do if I am tapped for Ga’Hoolol - ogy , ”
31321	31326	31327	31327	Soren	122	“ You ? Never , ”
31365	31400	31360	31360	she	200	“ The Great Ga’Hoole Tree has thrived and flourished for these thousands of years because the owls have been such excellent stewards of this little piece of earth that the Great Glaux gave them . ”
31412	31418	31419	31419	Otulissa	176	“ That is so rude , ”
31422	31430	31431	31431	Twilight	123	“ Oh , go yarp a pellet ! ”
31435	31473	31431	31431	Twilight	123	“ What ’s that ? Someone has a pellet to yarp ? Twilight dear , come up here . I believe I heard you say you had a little gift to bestow on our Great Ga’Hoole Tree . ”
31912	31982	31983	31983	Soren	122	“ Remember when Matron came in the other day to serve tea and she asked me to take the cup to him and to ask if he wanted his usual with it — whatever that was . I was so afraid I was going to say something like , ‘ Ezylryb , Matron would like to know if you ’d like your tea with your usual fourth talon . ’ ”
32314	32345	32298	32298	Gylfie	125	“ You can do better than that , young one . One day with that Philomena Bagwhistle slop is quite ’nuff , I’dsay . Whyn’t try something a little weightier ? ”
32346	32350	32351	32351	Gylfie	125	“ Like what ? ”
32358	32365	32368	32368	his	191	“ Try that one over there . ”
32488	32519	32521	32521	he	122	“ Look at the book , idiots , not my talons . Or , here , take a good look at the talons so you can get used to it . ”
32539	32546	32547	32547	Soren	122	“ We ’re used to it , ”
32550	32558	32559	32559	Ezylryb	191	“ Good . Now read the book , ”
32569	32587	32562	32562	Gylfie	125	“ Tempers of the Gizzard : An Interpretative Physiology of This Vital Organ in Strigi - formes . ”
32588	32593	32595	32595	Soren	122	“ What are Strigiformes ? ”
32597	32600	32601	32601	Gylfie	125	“ Us , ”
32605	32625	32601	32601	Gylfie	125	“ That ’s the fancy name for all owls , whether we ’re Elf Owls or Barn Owls or … ”
32629	32634	32626	32626	Gylfie	125	“ a Whiskered Screech . ”
32635	32656	32657	32657	He	122	“ Right - o. Now go on , the both of you . Try something harder . Read it together . ”
32665	32689	32690	32690	He	122	“ And you can now quit wasting time thinking about my three talons . If you want to see it again you can . ”
32818	32827	32828	32828	Soren	122	“ I think we can skip the footnotes , ”
32838	32847	32828	32828	Soren	122	“ This is boring enough as it is . ”
32848	32857	32858	32858	Gylfie	125	“ Oh , I always skip the footnotes , ”
32861	32875	32858	32858	Gylfie	125	“ How many books with footnotes have you read , Gyl - fie ? ”
32881	32893	32897	32897	her	125	“ One . It was about feather maintenance . But look . ”
32969	32979	32965	32966	an owl	295	“ Oh , I feel it in my gizzard ? ”
33001	33009	33010	33010	Soren	122	“ Well , that ’s the truth , ”
33013	33025	33010	33010	Soren	122	“ There ’s not much new in that . Hardly original . ”
33026	33038	33010	33010	Soren	122	“ Hold on , Soren . Look what he says here . ”
33137	33151	33132	33132	Ezylryb	191	“ Why do you suppose he ’s having us read this , Gylfie ? ”
33152	33164	33165	33165	Gylfie	125	“ I think he ’s trying to send us a message , ”
33168	33181	33132	33132	Ezylryb	191	“ What ? Do n’t be stubborn ? Open up your gizzard ? ”
33182	33198	33199	33199	They	904	“ I do n’t know , but it ’s almost time for night flight exercises . ”
33219	33223	33224	33224	Gylfie	125	“ Very interesting , ”
33227	33234	33224	33224	Gylfie	125	“ Thank you for the suggestion . ”
33235	33241	33242	33242	Soren	122	“ Yes , thank you , ”
33263	33306	33307	33307	Soren	122	“ Great Glaux , I ’ll just die if I get tapped for the weather interpretation chaw . I mean , can you imagine having Ezyl - ryb as your chaw leader ? It ’s just too creepy to even think about , ”
33310	33335	33336	33336	Gylfie	125	“ You know if you get tapped for colliering , you automatically have to take weather interpretation and fly with that chaw as well , ”
33339	33357	33358	33358	Soren	122	“ Well , who wants to get tapped for colliering and get their beaked singed , anyway ? ”
33362	33382	33358	33358	Soren	122	“ You did n’t get it singed when you picked up the coal that you dropped on that bobcat . ”
33383	33396	33336	33336	Gylfie	125	“ We were all picking them up when we were burying them . ”
33397	33406	33358	33358	Soren	122	“ Yeah , but you flew with yours ! ”
33407	33414	33336	33336	Gylfie	125	“ That was pure dumb luck . ”
33415	33449	33358	33358	Soren	122	“ Maybe , but if you do it properly you never get singed , and that ’s what Bubo helps teach . It would be great to have Bubo as a chaw leader . ”
33450	33505	33336	33336	Gylfie	125	“ Yeah , but if you get Ezylryb with him , I would hardly call that a bargain . I think Bubo only helps . It ’s that other old owl , Elvan , who is the leader of colliering . I still do n’t see why you have to do weather with colliering . ”
33506	33563	33358	33358	Soren	122	“ Well , you have to fly into forest fires and pick up burning embers . And forest fires , they say , are like a weather system all by themselves . You have to know about the drafts and winds that the heat can cause . I heard Bubo talking about it the other day . ”
33580	33588	33589	33589	Soren	122	“ Ready for night flight , Digger ? ”
33592	33616	33336	33336	Gylfie	125	“ Yes . And I ’ve really improved . Much stronger , that ’s what Boron says . Wait until you see me . ”
33675	33695	33671	33671	he	909	“ Buddy up , tell a few jokes , yarp a few pellets , and hoot at the moon . ”
33696	33701	33702	33702	Boron	171	“ So , Twilight , ”
33705	33734	33702	33702	Boron	171	“ I ’ve got one that you ’ll like . Did you hear the story of the wet pooper who was flying over Hoolemere and hit a fish ? ”
33744	33751	33752	33752	she	176	“ He ’s just too much , ”
33755	33761	33762	33762	Soren	122	“ Who ’s too much ? ”
33765	33790	33791	33791	Soren	122	“ Our king , Boron . He ’s telling a wet poop joke . I think it ’s undignified for one of his position . ”
33794	33802	33791	33791	Soren	122	“ Give it a blow , Otulissa . ”
33816	33824	33811	33812	an owl	295	“ A little less serious , please . ”
33825	33853	33791	33791	Soren	122	“ Well , I sure hope he does n’t head a chaw . I would find it most unpleasant . You know , tonight the tappings begin ? ”
33854	33858	33811	33812	an owl	295	“ They do ? ”
33859	33884	33791	33791	Soren	122	“ Yes , and I just have a feeling in my gizzard that I ’m going to find ten nooties in my bedding down . ”
34010	34020	34021	34021	Otulissa	176	“ Do n’t you have any feelings , Soren ? ”
34024	34034	34035	34035	he	912	“ I prefer not to discuss my gizzardly feelings , ”
34040	34044	34300	34300	Primrose	181	“ Why not ? ”
34045	34082	34089	34089	Otulissa	176	“ I do n’t know . I ’m just not comfortable doing it . You know I do n’t mean to be rude , Otulissa , but for someone so well bred you push awfully hard . ”
34083	34088	34089	34089	Otulissa	176	“ Well , honestly . ”
34131	34146	34089	34089	Otulissa	176	“ What about you , Primrose ? Any little twinges in the old gizzard ? ”
34147	34221	34089	34089	Otulissa	176	“ Oh , I do n’t know , Otulissa . One minute I think I ’m a sure bet for search - and - rescue , which I ’d love , and then the next , I think they ’ll tap me for tracking , which I guess I would n’t mind . You know , I just do n’t know . I mean , I think that ’s part of the problem . ”
34222	34231	34089	34089	Otulissa	176	“ What do you mean — what problem ? ”
34232	34281	34089	34089	Otulissa	176	“ My gizzard — it ’s just so here , there , everywhere . I mean , when you said ‘ old gizzard , ’ I realized my gizzard is n’t so old , nor is yours for that matter , but you seem to know it better . ”
34282	34290	34291	34291	Otulissa	176	“ Oh , I know my gizzard . ”
34295	34299	34300	34300	Primrose	181	“ Lucky you , ”
34352	34373	34338	34338	Soren	122	“ Primrose , were you in the library reading that book about the physiology and the temper of owl gizzards ? ”
34374	34470	34338	34338	Soren	122	“ Oh , great Glaux , no . I only read joke books and romances , for the most part , and never anything with any ‘ ol - ogy ’ in the title . Do you know that Madame Plonk has written a memoir about her love life ? She ’s had a lot of mates who died . The book is called My Fabulous Life and Times : An Anecdotal History of a Life Devoted to Love and Song . There ’s a lot about music in it . I love Madame Plonk . ”
34471	34479	34480	34480	Twilight	123	“ Who wants to read about that ? ”
34484	34509	34480	34480	Twilight	123	“ Enough to make a person yarp , all that romantic stuff . I like reading about weapons , battle claws , war hammers . ”
34510	34513	34515	34515	Otulissa	176	“ Well , ”
34517	34564	34515	34515	Otulissa	176	“ I do n’t especially like reading about weapons but I find Madame Plonk coarse and unrefined , and they say she ’s got a touch of the magpie in her . Have you ever been to her ‘ apartments , ’ as she calls them ? ”
34565	34570	34571	34571	Primrose	181	“ Oh , yes , ”
34580	34586	34571	34571	Primrose	181	“ Are n’t they beautiful ? ”
34587	34656	34515	34515	Otulissa	176	“ Oh , yes , beautiful with other creatures ’ things — bits of crockery and teacups made out of something she calls porcelain . Now where would she get that stuff ? Well , I think under all those snowy white feathers is a magpie in disguise — that ’s what I think . And frankly , I find the apartment vulgar — rather like its occupant . ”
34687	34696	34515	34515	Otulissa	176	“ When did you come here , Otulissa ? ”
34697	34835	34840	34840	Soren	122	“ It was during the time of the copper rose rain . I came from Ambala . You might have heard that Ambala suffered a great many egg snatchings because of St. Aggie ’s patrols . My mother and father had lost two eggs this way and had gone out to see if they could find them , somehow . I was left in the nest under the care of a very distracted aunt of mine . Well , she decided to go visit a friend , and I became worried . I could n’t fly yet , and do n’t for a minute think I was trying to . I was a very obedient owlet . I was only looking over the edge for Auntie , and I just fell . It ’s the honest truth . ”
34889	34892	34893	34893	Otulissa	176	“ Luckily , ”
34896	35006	35007	35007	She	920	“ some search - and - rescue patrols from the Great Ga’Hoole Tree came by and found me . They put me back into my nest and we waited and waited for my aunt and for my parents , but none of them ever returned . So , Imustassume that they met with disaster trying to recover the eggs . Of course , my aunt , well , I ’m not sure what really happened to her . As I said , she was a very scatterbrained owl — for a Spotted one . In any case , the patrols took me back here to the Great Ga’Hoole Tree . ”
35016	35024	35007	35007	She	920	“ I ’m an orphan like you . ”
35100	35112	35113	35113	she	920	“ It will be a short class tonight , young ones , ”
35118	35143	35113	35113	she	920	“ For as you know , this is a special night , and we want to be sure to get back before First Light . ”
35255	35261	35262	35263	Mrs. P.	128	“ No seconds , anyone ? ”
35266	35287	35262	35263	Mrs. P.	128	“ I ’d be happy to go back and get some , and there are more nice little nootie cakes . ”
35422	35437	35439	35439	others	1697	“ I told you so . I knew you ’d get into that chaw . ”
35472	35480	35481	35481	Digger	126	“ Well , good luck , everybody , ”
35484	35505	35481	35481	Digger	126	“ Twilight , I really hope you get what you want . I know how much it means to you . ”
35665	35669	35670	35670	Digger	126	“ A pellet ! ”
35673	35685	35670	35670	Digger	126	“ I got tracking chaw . I ca n’t believe it ! ”
35693	35704	35755	35755	Gylfie	125	“ Hooray ! I ’m search - and - rescue . ”
35712	35727	35755	35755	Gylfie	125	“ This iron tree is beautiful — great Glaux , I did get metals ! ”
35728	35736	35755	35755	Gylfie	125	“ A milkberry — oh , no ! ”
35737	35744	35755	35755	Gylfie	125	“ Ten nooties ! ! ! ! ”
35758	35778	35779	35779	Gylfie	125	“ Soren , I ca n’t believe it . I did n’t think Strix Struma liked me that much , ”
35806	35809	35810	35810	Digger	126	“ Soren , ”
35813	35819	35810	35810	Digger	126	“ what did you get ? ”
35820	35829	35783	35783	she	125	“ I … I … I’m not sure . ”
35830	35834	35835	35835	Gylfie	125	“ Not sure ? ”
35850	35861	35783	35783	she	125	“ I have n’t looked yet . I ’m scared . ”
35862	35865	35866	35866	Twilight	123	“ Soren , ”
35869	35888	35866	35866	Twilight	123	“ just look . Get it over with . Come on . It ca n’t be so bad . ”
35915	35921	35922	35922	Gylfie	125	“ Come on , Soren , ”
35942	35954	35929	35929	She	125	“ Come on . I ’ll stand right here beside you . ”
36014	36017	36077	36077	Soren	122	“ Colliering ! ”
36049	36066	36072	36072	Otulissa	176	“ I ca n’t believe it . I ’m on colliering and weather chaws . Disaster ! ”
36128	36396	36114	36114	Ruby	208	” This was their second chaw practice for colliering and Soren had never been more depressed , not since his horrible time at St. Aggie ’s . The colliering ryb , a Great Gray named Elvan , stood in the center of a circle that had been inscribed on the ground at the base of the tree . It was near the forge where Bubo worked , keeping them supplied with red - hot coals . Elvan barked commands at them and insisted that they march in time as he kept count . Soren had a deep aversion to marching . They had been forced to march all the time at St. Aggie ’s . Elvan said this marching was necessary to establish the proper rhythm that helped in holding a live coal in their beaks . And it seemed as if his previous experience with live coals in the woods of The Beaks had deserted him . He could hardly believe that he had actually picked up live coals , buried them , and flown with them ! Soren had spent the first minutes of class being scared and the remainder being bored . If anyone had told him that it was possible to be both in the same practice , he would have said they were yoicks . It was odd that he hardly felt the heat . He remembered thinking this before when he was in the woods of The Beaks . He did notice , however , that Elvan ’s fringe of light feathers below his beak seemed to be a permanently sooty gray .
36446	36452	36453	36453	Elvan	205	“ Pay attention ! Soren ! ”
36456	36463	36453	36453	Elvan	205	“ You nearly ran into Otulissa . ”
36506	36517	36518	36518	Elvan	205	“ All right , rest time . Drop your coals , ”
36538	36575	36530	36531	the ryb	869	“ Tomorrow you shall begin flying with the coals in your beaks . It is not that different , really , from walking . Although you must take care to keep your coal alive and burning . ”
36576	36579	36580	36580	Bubo	197	“ Yeah ! ”
36583	36617	36580	36580	Bubo	197	“ Dead coals ai n’t going to do me a bit of good , young’uns . No sense flying in here with a great lot of ashes , cold as Glaux knows what . ”
36618	36621	36623	36623	Elvan	205	“ Yes , ”
36625	36634	36623	36623	Elvan	205	“ We do n’t want to disappoint Bubo . ”
36635	36646	36647	36647	Otulissa	176	“ Oh , Glaux forbid that we should disappoint Bubo , ”
36762	36831	36755	36755	Elvan	205	“ And then , of course , after you have had enough nights of weather training we shall find a nice forest fire for you — nothing too big , mind you . Just a nice little beginning fire with a good mix of trees — Ga’Hooles , firs , pine , some soft and hard woods . Not too many ridges or mountains to complicate wind patterns . ”
36832	36836	36839	36845	the little Northern Saw - whet Owl	950	“ Pardon me , ”
36859	36864	36865	36865	Elvan	205	“ Yes , Martin , ”
36868	36899	36865	36865	Elvan	205	“ Well , I do n’t understand why we need new coals all the time . Once you start a fire going , would n’t there always be new coals ? ”
36935	36949	36930	36930	Elvan	205	“ Bubo , as chief smith , would you care to answer that ? ”
36950	36956	36958	36958	he	197	“ Sure thing , mate . ”
36973	37072	36958	36958	he	197	“ A very good question . You are right , it is very possible to keep fires going forever and that is fine for some things — things like cooking and warming up a hollow . But for certain tasks , especially certain metalwork in the forge , we need new fresh coals that have been born of sparking trees full of sap . They become the blood of our hottest fires . Then again , we need a variety of coals . Certain coals from certain trees last longer . That ’s how a fire gets bonk . ”
37073	37078	37080	37080	Martin	209	“ What ’s bonk ? ”
37082	37150	36958	36958	he	197	“ Ah , it ’s an old smithy term . Hard to explain unless you ’ve been working with the fires for some time . Then you know when you got a bonking good fire going in your forge . You know you got to look for the blue in the flame and then , this is the hardest , a tinge of green around the blue . ”
37206	37217	37218	37218	Otulissa	176	“ I simply ca n’t bear this a minute longer , ”
37221	37236	37238	37238	Ruby	208	“ I think it ’s going to be great fun when we can fly , ”
37254	37297	37218	37218	Otulissa	176	“ How can you say that , Ruby ? This is really not the appropriate chaw for you , either , no more than for me . You of all owls , with your family background — you should be in tracking . ”
37298	37317	37218	37218	Otulissa	176	“ Just because my family nested on the ground does n’t mean I ca n’t try something new . ”
37318	37332	37218	37218	Otulissa	176	“ But you fly low and slow ; that ’s good for tracking . ”
37333	37441	37442	37442	Ruby	208	“ But I ’ve never flown through a forest fire . And I ca n’t wait until weather interpretation — a hurricane ! Just imagine flying through that . Life in that ground nest was boring . We were out there in the grasslands — every day just the same . The sound of the wind in the grass just the same , the way the grass moved just the same . Oh , yes . Sometimes it moved slower or faster , depending on the wind . But there was a terrible sameness . I ca n’t believe how lucky I am to be double chawed . ”
37583	37606	37564	37564	She	208	“ They ’ll never find me here ! They ’ll never believe that an immature Short - eared made it to here ! ”
37695	37790	37689	37689	Bubo	197	“ It gets better , Soren . It really does . I know this is tough for you . It was n’t the chaw that you wanted , but it ’s really an honor — double chawed and all . I think you ’re the first Barn Owl ever to be . Come on now , lad . Come with me . Take tea in the forge . I got some fresh moles , you can have them raw or smoked — whatever takes your fancy , and Cook made a nice milkberry tart . ”
37928	37933	37894	37895	a blacksmith	953	“ you only wish . ”
37934	37939	37940	37940	Soren	122	“ What ’s this ? ”
37989	38003	37940	37940	Soren	122	“ Ah , me whirlyglass . Plonk helped put it together for me . ”
38004	38008	38009	38009	Soren	122	“ Madame Plonk ? ”
38030	38033	38024	38024	anyone	394	“ Plonk . ”
38034	38048	38049	38049	He	122	“ Oh , yeah , Plonk and me go back — way back . ”
38072	38092	38093	38093	Bubo	197	“ She ’s got a special relationship with Mags so she can get me lots of bits of glass . ”
38109	38170	38093	38093	Bubo	197	“ You know , when you start flying weather with Ezylryb , he wo n’t let you eat meat cooked . He likes you to eat it raw with the fur on it . Says you ca n’t fly into a blizzard or a hurricane with burnt - up meat in your gut and nothing for your gizzard to grind . ”
38171	38174	38176	38176	Soren	122	“ Oh , ”
38178	38184	38176	38176	Soren	122	“ But who ’s Mags ? ”
38185	38200	38203	38203	his	122	“ Oh , dear me , ai n’t you never heard of Trader Mags ? ”
38206	38237	38203	38203	his	122	“ I forget , you only just got here a bit ago , did n’t you , and Mags , I guess , she has n’t been here since summer . ”
38246	38263	38238	38238	Bubo	197	“ Those bright pieces came from what was called a window in something called a church . ”
38264	38267	38268	38268	Soren	122	“ Churches ! ”
38271	38294	38268	38268	Soren	122	“ I know about them . And that ’s stained glass from their windows ! Barn Owls used to live in churches . ”
38295	38315	38238	38238	Bubo	197	“ Certainly did . Some still do , live in churches and barns as well , and even castles . ”
38316	38324	38268	38268	Soren	122	“ Castles — what ’s a castle ? ”
38325	38366	38238	38238	Bubo	197	“ Well , it ai n’t a church and it ai n’t a barn , but it ’s a big old fancy thing made from big stones , towers , walls , one of them things that the Others made . ”
38452	38455	38456	38456	Soren	122	“ Castles , ”
38460	38469	38456	38456	Soren	122	“ Sounds exciting , beautiful — very grand . ”
38470	38506	38456	38456	Soren	122	“ Oh , grand indeed . But you ask me , no owl , Barn Owl or not , belongs in a church or a barn or a castle . Better life in a tree . ”
38507	38515	38456	38456	Soren	122	“ But you live in a cave . ”
38516	38521	38456	38456	Soren	122	“ That ’s different . ”
38522	38529	38456	38456	Soren	122	“ I do n’t see why . ”
38543	38555	38530	38530	Bubo	197	“ Got a lively mind , do n’t you , lad ? ”
38556	38562	38563	38563	Soren	122	“ I do n’t know . ”
38586	38596	38582	38582	Bubo	197	“ Do n’t you want to know about glass ? ”
38601	38604	38606	38606	Bubo	197	“ Well , ”
38608	38627	38606	38606	Bubo	197	“ the churches and castles , they have these windows made of glass and they colored the glass . ”
38628	38642	38606	38606	Bubo	197	“ Oh , I read about that in a book in the library . ”
38643	38697	38606	38606	Bubo	197	“ Yes , they made it all pretty . Well , Mags the trader , she knows where there are a lot of broken - down old churches with smashed - up windows . Leave it to a magpie to find such bits , but that ’s their nature and she knows Plonkie . ”
38709	38743	38749	38749	his	122	“ Plonkie has a weakness for all these colored bits and things . So Mags always brings a bagful with her here when she comes to trade . Plonk thought this place needed brightening up”—Bubo
38750	38781	38749	38749	his	122	talons—“so she made me this whirlyglass . Plonk has a number of them in her apartments — as she call her place — ridiculous name , if you ask me . ”
38798	38834	38789	38789	Soren	122	“ Do n’t you miss living in a tree ? I mean , it ’s not like you were born a Burrowing Owl used to living in holes . Do n’t you miss the sky ? ”
38935	38992	38993	38993	He	122	“ I warn’t born a Burrowing Owl , that ’s the truth . I be a Great Horned , and it ai n’t customary for any Great Horned to go about life in a cave . But you see , I be a smith . It ’s in my gizzard , this feeling for the metals . ”
39008	39181	38993	38993	He	122	“ And we smiths , no matter if we ’re Great Grays or Great Horneds or Snowies or Spotted Owls , get these special feelings in the old gizzard , you know . We fly , yes , we love the sky , but we is drawn to the earth as well — not like the Burrowing Owls , not the same thing at all . It be a strange and most peculiar force . It ’s as if all these years working with the iron , we get a bit of the magnet in us , you know . Like them special metals , you know , iron . It ’s got what we call a field . Well , you ’ll be learning this in metals class , in higher magnetics , where all the unseeable parts are lined up . It makes this force that draws you — same thing with me — I get drawn to the very earth from which them little flecks of iron come from . ”
39182	39185	39186	39186	Soren	122	“ Flecks ! ”
39203	39227	39186	39186	Soren	122	“ What ’s a matter , boy ? You got ta yarp ? Go right ahead . We ai n’t formal around here . ”
39228	39263	39186	39186	Soren	122	“ At St. Aggie ’s , they made us pick apart pellets for bones and things and then something they called ‘ flecks . ’ Only first - degree pickers could pick for flecks . ”
39264	39270	39186	39186	Soren	122	“ You do n’t say ? ”
39276	39308	39186	39186	Soren	122	“ But Gylfie and I never knew what flecks were . And , of course , we could never ask . But we did know they were kept in the library . ”
39309	39316	39186	39186	Soren	122	“ Odd place to keep iron . ”
39317	39326	39186	39186	Soren	122	“ Is that what flecks are — iron ? ”
39327	39452	39453	39453	He	197	“ Yes , in their smallest bits , but better if you can find a nice big hunk of iron ore , just like if you can find a nice hunk of silver or gold in a creek . The metals chaw brought me back a very handsome piece of gold the other day . Would n’t you know Plonk spotted me with it practically as soon as they lit down and was all over me to make something for her . ‘ Course Boron and Barran will have a thing or two to say ‘ bout that . Silver , gold , that is all kept for the whole tree and not for one vain old Snowy with a taste for the glitter . ”
39462	39525	39527	39527	he	197	“ Speaking of which , Plonk ’s going to start singing good light any minute . You better fly on up to your hollow . A lot to do tomorrow . Elvan thinks you ’ll be ready to fly with the coals . Now you pay attention , son . Do n’t go smacking into Otulissa like you nearly did in practice . ”
39532	39562	39527	39527	he	197	“ You know , not everyone is chosen to be double chawed like you . Boron and Barran must think you got something special . And Ezylryb , too . ”
39563	39580	39527	39527	he	197	“ But why me ? I do n’t get it . I ’m not that special . ”
39581	39595	39527	39527	he	197	“ Oh , but you are . You had the mark on you . ”
39596	39608	39527	39527	he	197	“ The mark on me ? What are you talking about ? ”
39609	39670	39671	39671	Bubo	197	“ Ezylryb spotted it . None of the rest of us could see it , of course . He got something special with that squinted eye of his . You ’d been messing about with coals — hadn’t you , lad ? Ai n’t nothing to be ashamed of . Good Glaux , no ! Flew with one , maybe ? ”
39681	39692	39673	39673	his	197	“ I did , but I washed off the smudge . ”
39693	39758	39673	39673	his	197	“ Ah , but you still be marked . Only none else can see it , except Ezylryb . He ’s a tough one , Ezylryb . And smart ! Smartest owl in the whole place . He would n’t just choose any old owl . He wanted you , mark or no mark . So you be all you can be , Soren . ”
39857	39865	39841	39841	Digger	126	“ Soren , are you all right ? ”
39866	39871	39841	39841	Digger	126	“ Yeah , why ? ”
39872	39903	39841	39841	Digger	126	“ I ’m just worried about you . I mean , you ’ve been so quiet since the tapping , and you did n’t come to tea , and all . ”
39904	39919	39841	39841	Digger	126	“ Well , do n’t worry , Digger , it ’s not your problem . ”
39920	39925	39841	39841	Digger	126	“ But it is . ”
39926	39957	39841	39841	Digger	126	“ No , it ’s not , Digger . You worry too much . You just need to worry about yourself . Not me . That ’s not your job . ”
39958	39967	39968	39968	Digger	126	“ It ’s not a job , Soren , ”
39978	39985	39968	39968	Digger	126	“ It is what I am . ”
39986	39995	39975	39975	his	126	“ Now what do you mean by that ? ”
39996	40060	39968	39968	Digger	126	“ Well , you might think I ’m only a Burrowing Owl , you know , perfect for tracking with my long strong legs , but I am more than just this bunch of feathers and bare legs . I ca n’t explain it . I just feel things . And right now I am feeling very sorry , very bad for you . ”
40245	40259	40238	40238	Digger	126	“ Soren , what do you think it means to be an owl ? ”
40260	40277	40486	40486	Digger	126	“ I do n’t know . I mean , I ’m not sure what you mean . ”
40278	40286	40287	40287	Digger	126	“ I ’m not sure , either , ”
40290	40378	40287	40287	Digger	126	“ But it ’s just as if it is so easy to describe us . You know , there are so many things that we have that are different from other birds , but do you really think that is the meaning of being an owl ? Just because our heads can spin nearly all the way around , that we can see what other birds can not at night , that we fly slow and silent — is it just these differences that make us owls ? ”
40379	40395	40486	40486	Digger	126	“ Digger , why do you ask these questions ? They ’re impossible to answer . ”
40396	40485	40287	40287	Digger	126	“ Maybe that ’s why I ask them — because they are impossible to answer . It ’s kind of exciting . It means that there can be unexpected truths and meanings to why we are what we are . You see — that is why I know I am much more than strong legs and weak wings . And you are , too , Soren — you are more than your lovely white face and your sharp ears that can hear anything and your strange black eyes . ”
40689	40697	40698	40698	Gylfie	125	” something hissed in Soren ’s ear . “
40718	40718	40715	40715	you	125	”
40719	40724	40725	40725	Soren	122	“ Not at all . ”
40739	40755	40729	40729	Gylfie	125	“ Soren , there ’s a very important meeting going on in the parliament hollow . ”
40756	40759	40725	40725	Soren	122	“ So ? ”
40760	40772	40729	40729	Gylfie	125	“ Soren , I think they are talking about the Barred Owl and”—Gylfie
40778	40782	40725	40725	Soren	122	tight—“and … and … ”
40792	40800	40783	40783	Gylfie	125	“ The ‘ you only wish . ’ ”
40807	40812	40801	40801	Soren	122	“ You ’re kidding . ”
40813	40830	40725	40725	Soren	122	“ I would n’t kid about something like this , Soren , and you know it . ”
40831	40853	40801	40801	Soren	122	“ How do you know this ? I mean , how did you find out ? Were you in the meeting ? ”
40866	41005	40860	40860	her	125	“ Look , I know it ’s not nice to eavesdrop , but I could n’t sleep and you know how Cook always says come down to the kitchen if we ca n’t sleep and she ’ll make us a nice cup of milkberry tea . So I went down , and on my way back I just thought I ’d take a different route , so I followed one of those deep inner passageways that is very winding and pretty narrow , and it actually started to go down instead of up toward the sleeping hollows . There ’s a spot where something happens to the timber of the Great Ga’Hoole Tree . It is very thin , and I could hear voices , and then I found this perfect slot that is just Elf Owl size . ”
41006	41016	41017	41017	Soren	122	“ Do they have one just Barn Owl size ? ”
41020	41041	41017	41017	Soren	122	“ Maybe . There ’s an even better one my size higher up , but I would need a perch . ”
41042	41049	41050	41050	Twilight	123	“ At your service , Gylf ! ”
41055	41078	41050	41050	Twilight	123	“ What a team we ’ll make . On the shoulders of giants , the little Elf will bring back the word ! ”
41079	41084	41085	41085	Soren	122	“ Twilight , puhleeze ! ”
41088	41096	41085	41085	Soren	122	“ Why not ? Makes perfect sense . ”
41097	41130	41132	41132	Soren	122	“ Well , I might not be a giant like you , but I can hear better than any of you . I ’m going , too . So count me in , ”
41134	41139	41140	41140	Digger	126	“ Me , too . ”
41152	41163	41164	41164	Gylfie	125	“ Do you even know what we ’re talking about ? ”
41171	41199	41167	41169	the Burrowing Owl	127	“ No , but we ’re a band , remember ? Nobody gets left out . Fill me in on the way to whatever we ’re doing . ”
41344	41374	41342	41342	Digger	126	“ And so you say , Bubo , that no trace of the dear Barred Owl was found ? Our noble servant perished in the region of The Beaks ? ”
41405	41430	41399	41399	Soren	122	“ Not rightly sure if he exactly perished , Boron . I mean he might n’t be dead . He might just be captured . ”
41431	41439	41399	41399	Soren	122	“ By St. Aggie ’s patrols or … ”
41504	41515	41518	41518	Ezylryb	191	“ Either way it ’s a bad piece of work . ”
41526	41551	41552	41552	Bubo	197	“ We done lost one of our best slipgizzles and a darned fine smith as well , one of the best of the rogues . ”
41584	41586	41578	41578	He	122	“ rogue ”
41598	41604	41606	41606	Barran	172	“ Without a reliable slipgizzle , ”
41610	41630	41606	41606	Barran	172	“ it ’s going to make it very difficult to get any information about their activities in The Beaks . ”
41631	41645	41606	41606	Barran	172	“ It was a very strategic spot where he set up his forge . ”
41731	41742	41743	41743	Boron	171	“ That old Barred had ears like a Barn Owl , ”
41747	41937	41743	41743	Boron	171	“ We got more information from him than three other slipgizzles put together . And , as you said , my dear , his forge in The Beaks was ideally situated near the four points area where Ambala , The Beaks , Kuneer , and Tyto almost touch . Could n’t be better . Flew egg guard in Tyto , I hear . Trained up a bunch of young ones to go into Ambala when they were having the worst of their problems … Oh , my . Well , to the immediate business . We must not lose a moment in shoring up the four points region . We ’re going to need to cultivate a new slipgizzle , of course , but in the meantime we ’ll have to send out some egg patrols and a small reconnaissance team . Nothing too big . Do n’t want to attract undue attention . I do n’t need to tell you how dangerous it will be with the recent reports we ’ve been getting . A lot of groundwork and , as you know , bobcats are numerous there . ”
41938	41943	41994	41994	Boron	171	“ I ’ll go ! ”
41959	41964	41966	41966	Bubo	197	“ Count me in , ”
41968	41972	41743	41743	Boron	171	“ And me . ”
41986	41993	41994	41994	Boron	171	“ I think that ’s enough , ”
42001	42009	41994	41994	Boron	171	“ Bubo , you sure about going ? ”
42010	42024	41743	41743	Boron	171	“ ‘ Course I ’m sure , sir . He was a smith . ”
42025	42053	41994	41994	Boron	171	“ Yes , Bubo , I know that , but you are our only smith . If we lose you … well , where would we be ? ”
42054	42151	41743	41743	Boron	171	“ I ai n’t going to get lost , sir . Ai n’t going to get captured . Ai n’t going to get eaten by a bobcat . You need me on this mission . I can see what happened in that cave . It takes a smith ’s eye and a smith ’s nose to figure something like this out . He could n’t have just vanished into thin air , and I do n’t believe the Barred could have been captured by St. Aggie ’s or them others . But there ’ll be clues . ”
42171	42175	42177	42177	Owl	155	“ you only wish ”
42179	42182	42184	42184	Boron	171	“ Well , ”
42186	42326	42184	42184	Boron	171	“ that taken care of , I think the time has now come to honor our brother the Barred Owl , who had no name and elected never to live with us on this island in the middle of the sea , never to be embraced by the lovely ancient limbs of our Great Ga’Hoole Tree , but served as nobly in his own peculiar way as any Knight of Ga’Hoole . Let us raise a flagon of milkberry mead and think gentle thoughts of this brave and noble owl who made safer the hollows and nestlings of so many other owls in the Kingdoms of Ambala , Kuneer , and Tyto . Slipgizzle beyond compare , artisan of metals , courageous defender against the growing tides of evil , a Glaux - blessed owl . Hear ! Hear ! ”
42367	42372	42373	42373	Digger	126	“ And to think , ”
42376	42386	42373	42373	Digger	126	“ that we are the ones who found him . ”
42387	42395	42397	42397	Gylfie	125	“ But that ’s just the problem , ”
42399	42412	42397	42397	Gylfie	125	“ What do we do now ? Tell Boron and Barran that ? ”
42413	42422	42423	42423	Twilight	123	“ Then they ’ll know we were eavesdropping , ”
42426	42429	42430	42430	Gylfie	125	“ Precisely , ”
42439	42499	42433	42433	Soren	122	“ I think we should n’t say anything , at least not now . Nothing we will say will change their plans . They still need to send in a reconnaissance team or whatever they call it and find a new slipgizzle . Our knowing that the Barred Owl is dead and telling them really does n’t change anything . ”
42500	42507	42508	42508	Gylfie	125	“ I think Soren ’s right , ”
42511	42531	42508	42508	Gylfie	125	“ You know , eavesdropping like this … well … I have a feeling Boron would really be mad . ”
42532	42535	42537	42537	Twilight	123	“ Definitely , ”
42587	42598	42599	42599	Twilight	123	“ Great Glaux , it ’s a mess out there , ”
42602	42609	42611	42611	Gylfie	125	“ It ’s cold , too , ”
42618	42623	42624	42624	Twilight	123	“ Hop under here , ”
42651	42654	42655	42655	Digger	126	“ Twilight ! ”
42658	42665	42655	42655	Digger	126	“ Watch it with that wing . ”
42666	42671	42688	42688	her	125	“ Gylf is cold . ”
42672	42684	42688	42688	her	125	“ I sure hope they will serve something hot for breakfast , ”
42692	42697	42699	42699	Twilight	123	“ Me , too , ”
42760	42776	42783	42783	Ezylryb	191	“ Over here , boy . Weather chaw eats it raw with the hair on . ”
42785	42788	42789	42789	Soren	122	“ What ? ”
42796	42804	42805	42805	Otulissa	176	“ You mean you have n’t heard ? ”
42811	42815	42816	42816	Soren	122	“ Heard what ? ”
42828	42839	42789	42789	Soren	122	“ We ’re having our first weather interpretation chaw tonight . ”
42840	42858	42789	42789	Soren	122	“ You have to be kidding , Otulissa . We are n’t going out in this gale . ”
42859	42866	42867	42867	she	176	“ Oh , but we are , ”
42870	42911	42867	42867	she	176	“ And I think it ’s outrageous . I ’m going to have a word with Strix Struma . I ’ll go right up to Barran if I have to . This is reckless . This is endangering our lives . ”
42912	42944	42789	42789	Soren	122	“ Oh , hush up , dearie . Sit down and eat your mouse — and all the hair , mind you , and that goes for every one of you . ”
43148	43200	43144	43144	his	191	“ Eat up , maties … every single little hair . You ’ve forgotten what raw meat tastes like with the fur , as you call it . Poot here is my first mate . He ’ll tell you what it ’s like to fly with no ballast in your gizzard . ”
43201	43255	43256	43256	Poot	219	“ I remember that time before I had acquired the taste for hair and thought I could go through that hurricane . Last time I ever tried that . Nearly got caught in the rim of the eye , I did . Now , you do n’t want to do that , young’uns . ”
43270	43287	43289	43289	Rudy	220	“ What happens if you get caught in the rim of the eye of a hurricane ? ”
43291	43325	43327	43327	Poot	219	“ Oh , you spin around till you ’re dead . Just around and around and around . Awful nasty way to go . Usually get your wings torn off in the process , ”
43329	43340	43341	43341	Octavia	218	“ Now , do n’t go scaring them , Poot , ”
43356	43387	43341	43341	Octavia	218	“ And please , young’uns , do n’t try that trick of slipping the fur under the table . Remember , I am the table and it itches something fierce . ”
43439	43447	43711	43711	Ezylryb	191	“ We take off upwind , naturally . ”
43462	43486	43487	43487	Ezylryb	191	“ We ’re going to fly straight out over the Sea of Hoolemere . Try to find the main part of the gale . ”
43494	43657	43487	43487	Ezylryb	191	“ Now listen up . Here ’s what you need to know about a gale , or any storm , really — except for hurricanes — they be a little different with their eyes and all . But what you got in a gale , or storm , is you got your gutter . That ’s what we call the main trough where the wind runs its punch through . It ’s at the center . It not be like the eye in a hurricane . Not nearly so dangerous . Then on either side of the gutter you ’ve got the scuppers . That ’s where the edge of the winds from the gutters spills over . Then at the very outside edge of the scuppers you got your swillages — more about them later . I fly point . Poot flies what we call upwind scupper . You just follow behind . Do what you ’re told . Any questions ? ”
43663	43710	43660	43660	her	176	“ Ezylryb , sir , with all due respect , I have to say that I am surprised that we are going out before it is completely dark . Is n’t there a very real danger that in this light we could be mobbed by crows ? ”
43719	43742	43711	43711	Ezylryb	191	“ With all due respect , Otulissa , no one else is yoicks enough to be out on a day like this ! ”
43876	43918	43870	43870	Otulissa	176	“ I have never heard of a ryb who used such poor judgment . This is so irresponsible . I am going to have to speak with Boron and Barran . I can not believe that they would approve of this . ”
44110	44118	44119	44119	Otulissa	176	“ Oh , for Glaux ’s sake , ”
44122	44126	44127	44127	Soren	122	“ What now ? ”
44149	44156	44127	44127	Soren	122	“ He is speaking with seagulls ! ”
44157	44160	44127	44127	Soren	122	“ So ? ”
44161	44249	44127	44127	Soren	122	“ So ? How can you say ‘ so , ’ Soren ? I know you come from a very fine family . I can see that you have been well brought up . You must know that seagulls are the absolute worst kind of bird . They are , pardon the coarseness of my language , the scum of the avian world . Trashy , loud . You want nothing to do with them . And look , there he is talking — laughing with them . ”
44250	44260	44261	44261	Soren	122	“ Maybe he ’s getting weather information from them , ”
44264	44273	44274	44274	Otulissa	176	“ Oh , now that ’s a thought , ”
44291	44302	44274	44274	Otulissa	176	“ I think I ’ll fly up and ask him . ”
44303	44311	44127	44127	Soren	122	“ Do n’t bother him , Otulissa . ”
44312	44328	44274	44274	Otulissa	176	“ No , you heard him say if we had any questions we should ask . ”
44334	44370	44127	44127	Soren	122	“ Pardon me , Ezylryb . I am most curious to know why you were — how shall I put it — consorting with seagulls ? I thought perhaps it was to gain weather information . ”
44371	44392	44127	44127	Soren	122	“ Seagulls ? Oh , no , darlin ’ . They are the dumbest birds on earth and the laziest . ”
44393	44405	44127	44127	Soren	122	“ Well , then why would you even consort with them ? ”
44406	44418	44127	44127	Soren	122	“ I was n’t consorting . I was telling dirty jokes . ”
44419	44422	44423	44423	Otulissa	176	“ What ? ”
44426	44493	44423	44423	Otulissa	176	“ Yes , they love wet poop jokes even though they are the wettest of all poopers . ‘ Oh , tell us another one Ezyl , ’ they always say ! And , I must admit , I get a few from them . But the blasted birds are so dumb , half the time they ca n’t remember the punch lines . Very frustrating . ”
44494	44500	44423	44423	Otulissa	176	“ Well , I never ! ”
44501	44510	44423	44423	Otulissa	176	“ The jokes were really funny , Otulissa , ”
44522	44566	44423	44423	Otulissa	176	“ Now , do n’t go getting your feathers in a twist , darlin ’ . You just mind your own business . Get back into position . We ’re getting near the gutter now . And this is when the fun begins . ”
44567	44572	44573	44573	Poot	219	“ Hoooh - hah ! ”
44582	44602	44573	44573	Poot	219	“ Here we go , mates . Climbing the baggywrinkles and then straight into the gutter . Follow us ! ”
44785	44799	44802	44802	Ezylryb	191	“ Oh , tickle me hollow bones . Ai n’t this the life ! ”
44834	44877	44820	44820	He	191	“ Now follow me to the edge of the scuppers , maties , and I ’ll show you the hurly - burly . And then we ’ll climb the baggywrinkles and dump right into the scuppers for the ride of your life . ”
44878	44885	44887	44887	Otulissa	176	“ What is he talking about ? ”
44889	44907	44887	44887	Otulissa	176	“ He should have given us a vocabulary list . He ’s very disorganized as a teacher . ”
44960	44965	44967	44967	Ezylryb	191	“ Here we go ! ”
44969	44992	44967	44967	Ezylryb	191	“ Now I want to see you punch the wind and then we pop the scuppers and it ’s tail over talons . ”
44993	44999	45000	45000	Otulissa	176	“ Oh , my heavens ! ”
45064	45070	45071	45071	she	208	“ Oh , come on ! ”
45074	45081	45071	45071	she	208	“ There ’s nothing to it . ”
45082	45108	45109	45109	Otulissa	176	“ Nothing to it . Who ’s ever heard of an owl flying upside down ? I think there ’s something most unsavory about it ! ”
45112	45129	45109	45109	Otulissa	176	“ It ’s reckless , unsafe — yes , unsavory , unsafe , un - owl . ”
45185	45213	45214	45214	Ezylryb	191	“ Push forward a bit with your talons and keep angling your tail . It gives you a lot of control and you can ride the waves , ”
45238	45243	45232	45232	she	176	“ this outrageous activity . ”
45244	45251	45252	45252	Poot	219	“ Oh , shut your beak ! ”
45425	45429	45432	45432	you	1043	” Primrose gasped . “
45440	45440	45432	45432	you	1043	”
45441	45451	45452	45452	Soren	122	“ It ’s not as hard as you think , ”
45456	45490	45452	45452	Soren	122	“ It really does n’t take that much skill . It ’s kind of like when you first start to fly . You have to just sort of believe you can do it . ”
45491	45496	45497	45497	Gylfie	125	“ But upside down ? ”
45500	45514	45515	45515	Twilight	123	“ Do you think a big burly Gray like me could do it ? ”
45518	45549	45515	45515	Twilight	123	“ Sure , if the conditions are right . See , that ’s the problem — you ca n’t try it until you ’re in the gutter of a gale . ”
45550	45556	45557	45557	Twilight	123	“ Gutter of a gale ? ”
45560	45579	45557	45557	Twilight	123	“ You telling me a gale has a gutter ? Now , I ’ve seen a lot but … ”
45659	45663	45665	45666	Mrs. P.	128	“ good soul , ”
45687	45698	45683	45683	Digger	126	“ He makes the best friend and the worst enemy . ”
45699	45711	45722	45722	her	125	“ You might not have seen the gutter of a gale , ”
45725	45760	45712	45712	Gylfie	125	“ I know you ’ve seen a lot , Twilight , but it is possible that you have not penetrated a gale in the same manner Soren did , under the instruction of Ezylryb . ”
45761	45836	45722	45722	her	125	“ Oh , I ’ve flown into the teeth of many a gale , Gylf . I might have been in the gutter and not known I was there . That I admit . Soren here , talking about all this structure of a gale business — just words , you know . No offense , mind you , Soren . But you can fly through something and not know what it ’s called . ”
45837	45869	45712	45712	Gylfie	125	“ Yes , I think you ’re right . Otulissa was making a big fuss about how Ezylryb should have given us a vocabulary list before we took off last night . ”
45870	45875	45876	45876	Primrose	181	“ Oh , honestly , ”
45879	45887	45876	45876	Primrose	181	“ was there ever a duller owl ? ”
45888	45945	45712	45712	Gylfie	125	“ Well , I am going to the library because that ’s part of our assignment now — to read up on the structure of gales and blizzards and hurricanes . But I ’m glad we flew it first . I think it will have more meaning . We ’re supposed to have a test soon . ”
45946	45955	45956	45956	Gylfie	125	“ A flying test or a book test ? ”
45959	45988	45712	45712	Gylfie	125	“ Book test . I promised to help Ruby . She ’s a fantastic flier but she has a hard time with book things — reading and writing . ”
45989	46004	46005	46005	Twilight	123	“ Believe me , as long as she can fly that ’s what counts . ”
46008	46021	46022	46022	Gylfie	125	“ The grand old sage of the Orphan School of Tough Learning ! ”
46233	46271	46227	46227	He	122	“ Hello , Ezylryb . It was a wonderful chaw . Do you think there ’s any chance of another gale coming through soon — or maybe a tornado ? Poot says tornadoes are fantastic to fly . ”
46355	46382	46336	46336	he	191	“ Better study for your test . And Ruby over there needs some help . Flies like a dream but ca n’t spell worth a pellet . ”
46420	46435	46390	46390	Ruby	208	“ This is sooo hard , Soren ! I ’ll never pass the test . ”
46436	46460	46390	46390	Ruby	208	“ Oh , come on , Ruby . You ’ll do fine . Anyone who flies like you ca n’t flunk a test . ”
46461	46497	46390	46390	Ruby	208	“ But it ’s all these words . I feel flight in my gizzard , but , you know , I ca n’t feel words in my gizzard , except maybe when Madame Plonk sings . ”
46511	46565	46502	46502	Ruby	208	“ Look , Ruby , I do n’t think you should try and feel words in your gizzard . You just have to learn a little bit of what they mean in your head — just for the test . Come on , I ’ll help you . Let ’s see the book . ”
46595	46612	46586	46586	Soren	122	“ Let ’s start right here with a gale , because that is what we know . ”
46613	46624	46625	46625	Ruby	208	“ But what in Glaux ’s name is a pyte ? ”
46638	46677	46625	46625	Ruby	208	“ A pyte is a unit of measurement roughly the wingspan of a Whiskered Screech like meself . It is used for measuring the different structures of a weather system such as gutters , scuppers , et cetera . ”
46678	46684	46686	46686	Ruby	208	“ What ’s et cetera ? ”
46688	46699	46700	46700	Soren	122	“ I do n’t think that ’s an important word , ”
46703	46718	46700	46700	Soren	122	“ Now we know what a pyte is , and that ’s what counts . ”
46740	46746	46747	46747	She	208	“ Finning in the sw — ”
46758	46764	46765	46765	Soren	122	“ Finning in the swillages , ”
46768	46773	46774	46774	Ruby	208	“ What is that ? ”
46777	46824	46747	46747	She	208	“ Ruby , you did it . You were the only one who could do it . Do n’t you remember ? You climbed the baggywrinkles out of the scuppers and flew right on the upper edge , twitching your tail . It was very advanced . ”
46825	46833	46835	46835	Ruby	208	“ Oh , you mean like this ? ”
46848	46895	46835	46835	Ruby	208	“ Yes , that ’s it . And it says here that the swillages are measured in tailspans of the individual owl . So if you feel the breeze on either side of your tail at one time you know that it is one tailspan wide . ”
46896	46917	46835	46835	Ruby	208	“ Oh , I ’ll never remember all this ! The words , the numbers , it ’s too much . ”
46918	46926	46835	46835	Ruby	208	“ Yes , you will , Ruby . ”
46944	46954	46955	46955	Soren	122	“ Did you get your chaw changed , Otulissa ? ”
46979	47004	46976	46976	her	176	“ No ! I ’m stuck and I ca n’t fly nearly as well as either of you . I ’ll probably get killed . ”
47030	47115	47119	47119	his	191	“ You ’ll do fine , child . Spotted Owls have an amazing talent for sensing pressure changes . Of course , it does make them fussy and hard to live with . I suggest you read that book over there — Atmospheric Pressures and Turbulations : An Interpreter ’s Guide . It was written by Strix Emerilla , a renowned weathertrix of the last century . But I always want a Spotted Owl in my chaw , even if they continually beak off . ”
47172	47178	47182	47182	she	176	“ A Strix wrote this ? ”
47187	47247	47182	47182	she	176	“ Oh , my goodness , it could be a relative . And , of course , you know , to become a weathertrix requires the most highly refined sensitivities of all . No wonder a Strix would become one . With our ancient lineage , I would imagine these skills have been honed to perfection through the ages . ”
47270	47296	47297	47297	Soren	122	“ Well , I do n’t know . I just do n’t know . I do n’t think I ’m sure about anything , really . ”
47353	47373	47374	47376	the other snake	1059	“ The harp guild is the most prestigious and I think it is my destiny to become a member , ”
47380	47408	47374	47376	the other snake	1059	“ You know , the way the owls feel things in their gizzards . Now I know that we do n’t have gizzards , but even so . ”
47409	47416	47417	47418	Mrs. P.	128	“ Mercy ! The very idea . ”
47431	47459	47426	47426	She	128	“ I think it is very presumptuous of us to ever think of ourselves as anything like these noble owls . We are not of their station . ”
47533	47538	47496	47496	she	128	“ But Mrs. P. , ”
47543	47553	47496	47496	she	128	“ you must have some preference for a guild . ”
47554	47658	47496	47496	she	128	“ Oh , it is more than a preference . When we went for our tour of the guilds , I knew immediately that the harp was for me . As I slipped through the strings from one note to another , climbing the scales , leaping octaves , the vibrations never left me . And the very best part was to try to — oh , how shall I explain — weave the music into Madame Plonk ’s voice . So that together the sound of the harp and the sound of Madame Plonk ’s voice made something so large and splendid . ”
47676	47682	47683	47686	the other nest snake	1062	“ Must be off myself , ”
47690	47742	47683	47686	the other nest snake	1062	“ I ’m just going around to drop in on Octavia , bring her a few well - seasoned milkberries . She does love them so and , as you know , she does keep the nest for Madame Plonk . Never can hurt , can it ? Ta - ta ! ”
47779	47807	47767	47768	Mrs. P.	128	“ To presume to have a gizzard and then go slithering off to Octavia , humming tunes and besieging her with milkberries . Well , I never ! ”
47824	47827	47866	47867	Mrs. P.	128	“ drop by ”
47870	47875	47866	47867	Mrs. P.	128	using?—“Sensibilities , artistic sensibilities . ”
47905	48017	47898	47898	me	0	” Soren could hardly keep his mind on what he was saying , as he had never in his life seen a hollow like this one . The air spun with colored light from the whirlyglasses that hung from the ceiling and sometimes jutted out from the walls , suspended on twigs jammed into cracks . There were several openings through which light poured . There were pieces of cloth embroidered with beautiful designs and one little niche spilled over with strands of luminous beads . Indeed , the hollow seemed to swirl with color . And in the middle of all this color there was a dazzling whiteness — Madame Plonk .
48032	48048	48018	48018	Soren	122	“ But I just know that Mrs. P. is rather shy and would never dare . ”
48049	48053	48054	48055	Madame Plonk	183	“ Mrs. P. ? ”
48059	48069	48054	48055	Madame Plonk	183	“ I do n’t believe I know this snake . ”
48070	48089	48018	48018	Soren	122	“ She came with me , ma’am . She ’s my family ’s old nest - maid snake . ”
48090	48107	48054	48055	Madame Plonk	183	“ Oh , and you were saying that she wants to be in the harp guild ? ”
48108	48113	48116	48116	he	122	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
48157	48170	48144	48145	Madame Plonk	183	“ But wanting is one thing . One can not merely want . ”
48171	48189	48144	48145	Madame Plonk	183	“ Yes , yes , just because you want something does n’t mean it should always happen . ”
48196	48224	48190	48191	Madame Plonk	183	“ Very wise , young’un . But tell me now — why do you think she , this Mrs. P. as you call her , wants it ? ”
48234	48238	48239	48239	he	122	“ You know , ”
48243	48289	48239	48239	he	122	“ some snakes might want it just because it is thought of as the most important guild , one for snakes who have served in nests of very old , distinguished families . But I do n’t think that is why Mrs. P. wants it . ”
48290	48293	48294	48295	Madame Plonk	183	“ No ? ”
48326	48343	48311	48311	He	122	“ No , I do n’t think she gives two pellets about that kind of thing . ”
48361	48388	48358	48358	he	122	“ I think she wants to be a member of this guild not because it is the most important but because it is the most artistic . ”
48396	48412	48389	48390	Madame Plonk	183	“ That ’s very interesting . Now what do you mean by artistic , young’un ? ”
48464	48537	48461	48461	Soren	122	“ When Mrs. P. spoke about music she said how when she visited the great harp , she tried to weave the notes not just through the strings of the harp but into your voice . So that together the sound of the harp and the sound of your voice made something that she called splendid and grand . Well , I think that is what it means to be an artist . ”
48572	48582	48563	48563	She	183	“ You are most unusual for a Barn Owl . ”
48594	48625	48583	48583	Soren	122	“ Now I think you must go . It is almost time for Evensong . So , go along . I hear you ’re doing quite well in weather chaw . ”
48654	48659	48641	48641	Octavia	218	“ Now fly along . ”
48660	48674	48675	48675	Soren	122	“ Yes , yes , thank you for your time , Madame Plonk , ”
48684	48687	48688	48689	Madame Plonk	183	“ Octavia ! ”
48698	48706	48688	48689	Madame Plonk	183	“ Octavia , come in here immediately . ”
48727	48735	48718	48718	she	183	“ Did you hear that , Octavia ? ”
48736	48751	48688	48689	Madame Plonk	183	“ Yes , ma’am . I think we got ourselves a G - flat ! ”
48814	48820	48821	48821	he	191	“ Bring the chaw up , ”
48825	48834	48821	48821	he	191	“ There ’s enough for them to observe . ”
48835	48840	48841	48841	Soren	122	“ What ! What ! ”
48850	48868	48845	48845	Poot	219	“ It ’s the middle of the day , Poot . We ’re supposed to be sleeping . ”
48869	48893	48841	48841	Soren	122	“ Not now , young’un . Important lesson , top of the tree . Cap wants you there now . Quick - o ! ”
48906	48908	48902	48902	Poot	219	“ Cap ”
49076	49085	49086	49086	Bubo	197	“ Put a mouse in it , Otulissa , ”
49101	49107	49108	49108	Ezylryb	191	“ Thank you , Bubo , ”
49117	49127	49128	49128	Ezylryb	191	“ Now , anyone know why we are here ? ”
49262	49279	49259	49259	she	176	“ But I just ate . How shall I ever fly on such a full stomach ? ”
49280	49285	49286	49286	Ezylryb	191	“ Do n’t worry , ”
49289	49354	49355	49355	He	191	“ We ’re not flying yet . Not until later . But I want you up here today because you ’re going to see how fire changes things — the wind , the clouds . You can see these changes even from here . You see , young’uns , there is a fire burning over there across Hoole - mere . A great fire . ”
49365	49411	49355	49355	He	191	“ So later , we shall cross Hoolemere . Then we ’ll fetch up on some high cliffs on the other side that are perfect for a closer look . We shall camp there for a day or two and then we shall fly in . ”
49465	49469	49533	49533	Soren	122	“ pressure differential , ”
49470	49474	49533	49533	Soren	122	“ thermal inversions , ”
49476	49480	49533	49533	Soren	122	“ convective columns . ”
49525	49532	49533	49533	Soren	122	“ Are you nervous , Ruby ? ”
49549	49559	49533	49533	Soren	122	“ I ’d be a fool not to be , ”
49567	49574	49533	49533	Soren	122	“ But you fly so well . ”
49575	49580	49581	49581	Martin	209	“ Not to mention , ”
49584	49597	49581	49581	Martin	209	“ that both of you are about twice as big as me . ”
49598	49606	49607	49607	Soren	122	“ What are you most scared of ? ”
49610	49617	49618	49618	Ruby	208	“ That thing they call crowning , ”
49622	49667	49618	49618	Ruby	208	“ When the fire leaps from treetop to treetop . I ca n’t imagine what it does to the air . I mean , flying through it must be almost impossible . You could never even half guess where the dead falls might be . ”
49668	49674	49581	49581	Martin	209	“ Technically , the fire does that”—Otulissa
49679	49696	49618	49618	Ruby	208	them—“because the fire climbs what is called , according to the literature , a fuel ladder . ”
49697	49705	49706	49706	Martin	209	“ Yes , and think of me , ”
49710	49744	49706	49706	Martin	209	“ I am on the ground , supposedly looking for the smallest embers . One of these crowning things happens , and at my weight I get sucked straight up the fuel ladder . ”
49745	49760	49761	49761	Soren	122	“ We all have to spend time on the ground , not just you , ”
49764	49781	49761	49761	Soren	122	“ It could happen to any of us . You do n’t have to be little . ”
50073	50084	50060	50060	his	191	“ We call them Ga’Hoole clouds . You know why ? ”
50091	50106	50085	50085	Otulissa	176	“ Because they are the shape of the seeds found in the Ga’Hoole fruits . ”
50107	50114	50115	50115	Ezylryb	191	“ Right - o , missy , ”
50124	50132	50118	50118	Martin	209	“ She never stops , does she ? ”
50169	50184	50154	50154	He	209	“ Do n’t worry , Martin . You ’re going to be all right . ”
50185	50214	50250	50250	Ezylryb	191	“ Soren , that ’s kind of you , but do you realize that I am the first Saw - whet to ever be in the colliering chaw ? ”
50215	50225	50226	50226	Soren	122	“ They must think you ’re special , Martin , ”
50229	50237	50238	50238	Martin	209	“ But what if I ’m not ? ”
50258	50276	50250	50250	Ezylryb	191	“ The reason their tops are curved like that is because — well , you tell me . ”
50286	50318	50280	50280	Otulissa	176	“ It ’s simple weather physics . I was reading about it in Emerilla ’s , the renowned weathertrix ’s book — she ’s a Spotted Owl , I might add . ”
50336	50346	50347	50347	Ezylryb	191	“ Just get to the point , darlin ’ , ”
50350	50375	50347	50347	Ezylryb	191	“ Oh , yes , of course . It is because the winds atop the cloud are blowing much faster than the winds below . ”
50383	50400	50401	50401	he	122	“ I might become one of those burning airborne embers that Ruby grabs on the fly , ”
50410	50534	50401	50401	he	122	“ All right now , we camp here and we wait . We wait until the fire is safe for penetration and retrieval . Elvan and Bubo shall take over the mission at that point , directing you to the richest coal and ember beds . I shall remain here and watch the weather and fly in for periodic reports . You do as you ’re told and no one will get hurt . Ruby and Poot fly top layer . Elvan with Otulissa will be mid - layer . Below them is Soren , who covers Martin on the ground . Bubo and I will be ready if anyone needs help . You are to keep your eye out for your mate . ”
50572	50616	50617	50617	Soren	122	“ There ’s a possible temperature inversion at the east end of the valley . We ’re not sending any owl down there . Temperature inversions trap smoke , and then do you know what can happen when the smoke starts to rise ? ”
50642	50649	50650	50650	Ezylryb	191	“ Shut your beak , Otulissa , ”
50653	50675	50650	50650	Ezylryb	191	“ I feel that Soren might have the answer despite not being as deeply familiar as you are with Strix Emerilla . ”
50717	50737	50713	50713	he	122	“ I think that it means that when the smoke rises there could be a change in the air . ”
50779	50805	50763	50763	Soren	122	“ The air would rise and turn and circulate upward and when this happens , I think the fire will burn harder , more fiercely . ”
50806	50809	50811	50811	Ezylryb	191	“ Exactly ! ”
50813	50823	50811	50811	Ezylryb	191	“ And how do you know this , lad ? ”
50824	50856	50763	50763	Soren	122	“ I see it in my mind . I can imagine it . I feel something , I think in my gizzard , about the movement of air and heat and … ”
50857	50865	50866	50866	Ezylryb	191	“ Yes , thank you , lad . ”
50876	50907	50866	50866	Ezylryb	191	“ There are many ways to learn — through books , through practice , and through gizzuition . They are all good ways , but few of us have gizzuition . ”
50908	50914	50915	50915	Otulissa	176	“ But what is gizzuition ? ”
50930	50978	50925	50925	his	191	“ It is a kind of thinking beyond the normal reasoning processes by which one immediately apprehends the truth , perceives and understands reality . It can not really be taught , but it can be developed by being extremely attentive and sensitive to the natural world . ”
51099	51108	51109	51109	Ezylryb	191	“ Eat light , eat all the hair ! ”
51112	51122	51123	51123	Martin	209	“ I wonder why he always calls it hair ? ”
51127	51152	51153	51153	Ruby	208	“ They say he comes from a distant place called the land of the Great North Waters and they have odd ways of speaking , ”
51156	51164	51165	51165	Martin	209	“ But hair ? What ’s hair ? ”
51168	51187	51188	51188	Ruby	208	“ Well , there ’s fur and there ’s feathers — I think it ’s something in between , ”
51191	51200	51188	51188	Ruby	208	“ Do you want me to ask Otulissa ? ”
51201	51204	51205	51205	Soren	122	“ No ! ”
51226	51231	51218	51218	Bubo	197	“ Prepare to fly . ”
51262	51265	51257	51257	Bubo	197	“ FIRE ! ”
51492	51500	51501	51501	Elvan	205	“ You ’ll get used to it . ”
51511	51528	51529	51529	He	122	“ It ’s always a shock at first . There is no way to describe it . ”
51621	51633	51612	51612	He	197	“ Good ember beds ahead . Perfect for all of you . ”
51663	51669	51671	51671	Poot	219	“ Beautiful catch , Ruby , ”
51673	51684	51685	51685	Elvan	205	“ What a natural that Short - eared Owl is ! ”
51732	51740	51741	51741	Elvan	205	“ All right , Martin going in ! ”
51758	51764	51747	51749	The little owl	685	“ Cover him , Soren . ”
51912	51919	51920	51920	Elvan	205	“ Play your position , Otulissa , ”
51931	51947	51920	51920	Elvan	205	“ But all the good ones go up there . We never get a chance . ”
51948	51969	51978	51978	them	1125	“ Shut your beak . You want to be sent back to the ridge ? You ’ll have your chance . ”
52028	52035	52036	52036	Bubo	197	“ He ’s coming in loaded ! ”
52075	52084	52063	52063	his	197	“ I did it ! I did it ! ”
52085	52092	52093	52093	Bubo	197	“ You certainly did , young’un . ”
52106	52115	52116	52116	Martin	209	“ I ca n’t wait to go back , ”
52119	52124	52125	52125	Elvan	205	“ Hold on there , ”
52128	52134	52125	52125	Elvan	205	“ First , your report . ”
52135	52148	52103	52103	his	197	“ Embers about the size of pellets uphill from where I landed . ”
52149	52152	52153	52153	Elvan	205	“ Excellent , ”
52167	52216	52103	52103	his	197	“ Soren , there is nothing like it . I ca n’t tell you . As soon as I got there I just was n’t frightened at all . And I ca n’t describe what it ’s like to grab the cinders in your beak . It ’s … ”
52217	52220	52221	52221	Otulissa	176	“ Intoxicating , ”
52225	52260	52221	52221	Otulissa	176	“ Yes , I read about it . You must be careful , though . Strix Emerilla wrote that some colliers get so drunk on the cinders that they do not heed weather warnings . ”
52261	52286	52287	52287	he	1126	“ Well , it ’s very strange the feeling you get when you grab them and then fly with them . It ’s something , ”
52290	52295	52287	52287	he	1126	“ Something very powerful . ”
52296	52309	52310	52310	Elvan	205	“ Now ’s the time , Soren . You ’re going in ! ”
52313	52318	52319	52319	Otulissa	176	“ What about me ? ”
52322	52332	52333	52333	Bubo	197	“ Shut your beak , your turn will come , ”
52645	52652	52653	52653	I	0	“ A Coal in My Beak ! ”
52796	52829	52791	52791	Martin	209	“ You were spectacular , Soren . I was so nervous when I saw that crown fire break and then when we saw you getting sucked up , I nearly went yeep . ”
52830	52835	52836	52836	Soren	122	“ But what happened ? ”
52854	52865	52791	52791	Martin	209	“ You mean to tell me you do n’t know ? ”
52866	52870	52791	52791	Martin	209	“ Not exactly . ”
52871	52940	52791	52791	Martin	209	“ You did a reverse loop to escape the pull and as you were coming out of it this coal flew by . Bubo said he never saw a coal of that size go up so high , but you caught it ! Caught it on the loop , Soren . I mean it was better flying than anything Ruby has ever done . It was absolutely spectacular . ”
52941	52952	52953	52953	Soren	122	“ Great Glaux , I wish I ’d seen it , ”
52960	52971	52956	52956	Martin	209	“ You did it , Soren ! You did it ! ”
52994	53003	52981	52981	She	176	“ I got one ! I got one ! ”
53016	53030	53006	53006	she	176	“ But , Soren , it is nothing compared to what you did . ”
53031	53050	53051	53051	Otulissa	176	“ Well , thank you , Otulissa … er … uh … That is very kind of you . ”
53071	53080	53062	53062	Martin	209	“ I wonder how long that will last ? ”
53195	53206	53207	53207	he	191	“ I hear you did a fair night ’s work , ”
53216	53221	53222	53222	He	191	“ Magnificent , perhaps . ”
53252	53261	53262	53262	Elvan	205	“ Do n’t worry about crows and mobbing , ”
53265	53277	53262	53262	Elvan	205	“ They never come near when we ’re carrying live coals . ”
53657	53662	53663	53663	Soren	122	“ Where ’s Twilight ? ”
53677	53681	53663	53663	Soren	122	“ And Primrose ? ”
53700	53731	53732	53732	Gylfie	125	“ They ’re both out on a mission and so is Digger . They needed the tracking and search - and - rescue chaws . Something big ’s going on , ”
53735	53738	53732	53732	Gylfie	125	“ What ? ”
53739	53764	53768	53768	he	122	“ I ’m not sure exactly . Boron is being very quiet about it . But suddenly a lot of owlets need rescuing fast . ”
53858	53869	53870	53870	Otulissa	176	“ Thank goodness we can now have our vole roasted , ”
53873	53885	53870	53870	Otulissa	176	“ It seems like forever since we ’ve had anything cooked . ”
53886	53906	53907	53908	Mrs. P.	128	“ I would have thought you would have had your fill of things roasting after flying into that fire , ”
53916	53927	53907	53908	Mrs. P.	128	“ Now I do have a little announcement to make . ”
53937	53945	53946	53946	Soren	122	“ What is it , Mrs. P. ? ”
53949	53962	53946	53946	Soren	122	“ Well , I have been asked to join the Harp Guild . ”
53963	53969	53970	53970	they	1153	“ Oh , Mrs. P. ! ”
54028	54031	54023	54023	he	122	“ perfect , ”
54135	54161	54129	54130	Mrs. P.	128	“ Come up later , Soren dear , and sit with me a spell and tell me all about your adventures in the burning forest . ”
54162	54168	54169	54169	he	122	“ Sure , Mrs. P. , ”
55103	55113	55114	55114	she	1191	“ It was n’t supposed to be like this , ”
55118	55128	55129	55129	Twilight	123	“ Now you take it easy , little Sooty , ”
55136	55163	55129	55129	Twilight	123	“ We ’re going to get you nice and fixed up . Do n’t you worry . You ’re in the talons of a champ here ! ”
55273	55289	55260	55262	the little Sooty	139	“ My Tyto , my Tyto , why hast thou forsaken us in our purity ? ”
55302	55341	55290	55290	Twilight	123	“ What are you talking about ? Forsaken ? You call this forsaken ? Look , I ’m not Glaux but you ’re safe right here in my talons . Safer than you were down on the ground . ”
55364	55434	55355	55356	Strix Struma	187	“ Do n’t be upset , Twilight . All these owlets are babbling some kind of nonsense . It ’s all very weird . This is not like what they did at St. Aggie ’s with the moon - blinking business , but it ’s strange . Very strange talk all the time about Tyto . Bubo and Boron are on their way and Ezylryb is coming as well . ”
55435	55438	55439	55439	Twilight	123	“ Ezylryb ? ”
55480	55512	55514	55515	Strix Struma	187	“ We need all the help we can get and not just for the rescue . Something ’s going on out here and we must get to the bottom of it . ”
55607	55636	55637	55637	She	187	“ Get that Sooty back to the gathering spot and then if you have it in you and feel you could fly one more mission , do so . ”
55642	55662	55665	55665	Elsie	227	“ All this talk about purity and Tytos . Never heard such a bunch of babble in my life . ”
55761	55767	55768	55768	Matron	175	“ Over here , Twilight , ”
55771	55800	55768	55768	Matron	175	“ I have just fluffed up a place . That Sooty will fit in nicely . Elsie dear , spare me a bit more down for this Sooty . ”
55869	55883	55856	55859	One little Grass Owl	228	“ Tytos now forever , so pure , so rare ! Yet supreme ! ”
55902	55925	55939	55939	he	197	“ Oh , Tyto , who is pureness beyond compare , show thyself … Tyto , how long shall the impure triumph ? ”
55926	55935	55936	55936	Bubo	197	“ Depressing little ditties , are n’t they ? ”
55946	55953	55954	55954	Twilight	123	“ What are they talking about ? ”
55957	55980	55939	55939	he	197	“ I do n’t know , but I ’ve heard more cheerful tunes in my day than all this whining about Tytos . ”
56007	56011	56013	56013	Primrose	181	“ My goodness , ”
56015	56031	56032	56032	She	1205	“ It ’s enough to make you long for a nice little wet poop joke . ”
56231	56240	56227	56229	a Tyto alba	1208	“ Coo coo ROOOO ! Coo coo ROOOO ! ”
56275	56282	56283	56283	Twilight	123	“ What have we got here ? ”
56286	56303	56283	56283	Twilight	123	“ Another Barn Owl , but not a Masked or a Sooty or a Grass Owl . ”
56304	56307	56308	56308	Twilight	123	“ No , ”
56314	56319	56308	56308	Twilight	123	“ A Tyto alba . ”
56320	56324	56325	56325	they	1209	“ Like Soren , ”
56344	56352	56331	56331	Digger	126	“ Do you think it could be ? ”
56353	56356	56357	56357	Twilight	123	“ Remember , ”
56360	56416	56357	56357	Twilight	123	“ how Soren once told us that his sister had a speckle near her eye . That it looked as if one of those dots from her head feathers had just slipped down to her eye and that it was the same with his mother , that she , too , had a slipped dot ? ”
56417	56420	56422	56422	Digger	126	“ Yes , ”
56425	56428	56357	56357	Twilight	123	“ Look ! ”
56498	56501	56502	56502	they	754	“ Eglantine ? ”

56585	56604	56502	56502	they	754	“ Poor little fellow . Now stop that babbling , dear . You do n’t have enough energy . ”

57830	57889	57816	57816	her	183	“ See , Eglantine . Ever since I have been here , I have collected a few berries from each season . So I have white ones from winter and silver from spring and now I ’ve got my golden ones from summer , and I ’m making a necklace . I ’ll make you one , too . ”

57991	58056	57973	57973	her	176	“ Look , I ’ve been in the library all this time working on Tyto research , to see if there is anything that would explain this — all of them being Tytos and babbling about Tytos , but I somehow got distracted and started looking at a book by a distinguished Spotted Owl that ’s about owls ’ brains and feelings and gizzards . ”
58057	58061	58062	58062	Twilight	123	“ Great Glaux , ”
58074	58084	58062	58062	Twilight	123	“ No doubt a relative of yours , Otulissa . ”
58085	58165	57973	57973	her	176	“ Well , possibly . There were many distinguished intellects in our ancestry and we do go back so far . Anyhow , in this book it says that your sister might be suffering from something he calls ‘ gizzlemia . ’ It is a blankness of the gizzard . It is as if the gizzard is just walled off and nothing can get through , and because of this there is a malfunction in the brain as well . ”
58166	58174	58175	58175	Soren	122	“ Well , that explains so much , ”
58179	58193	58175	58175	Soren	122	“ What in Glaux ’s name am I supposed to do about it ? ”
58194	58199	58200	58200	Otulissa	176	“ Well … well , ”
58203	58244	58245	58245	Otulissa	176	“ I ’m not sure . I just thought you ’d like to know what ’s making her this way . It ’s not as if she does n’t want to remember you . She just ca n’t help it , ”
58249	58262	58263	58263	Soren	122	“ I … I mean … I’m sure she loves you still . ”
58272	58285	58263	58263	Soren	122	“ Oh , dear . None of this is coming out right . ”
58293	58302	58286	58286	Otulissa	176	“ I was just trying to be helpful . ”

59695	59783	59784	59784	she	130	“ Just staring at this stone here , with the sparkles . Ai n’t really gold , Mags says — just little bits of something she calls isinglass , some calls it mica . But makes a right pretty rock . Kind of sparkly in places and , if you hold it up , light can shine through it a bit . It ’s kind of like a dusty mirror . Certainly caught your sister ’s fancy . There be something wrong with her , I s’pose ? ”

61828	61836	61837	61837	Digger	126	“ Why wo n’t she admit it ? ”
61840	61888	61692	61704	the Great Ga’Hoole Tree A peek at THE GUARDIANS of GA’HOOLE Book Three	1325	“ I think she ’s sensitive about coming from the great North Waters . She says everyone there is very superstitious , but I do n’t know , I guess she just thinks the owls here will laugh at her or something . I ’m not sure . ”
