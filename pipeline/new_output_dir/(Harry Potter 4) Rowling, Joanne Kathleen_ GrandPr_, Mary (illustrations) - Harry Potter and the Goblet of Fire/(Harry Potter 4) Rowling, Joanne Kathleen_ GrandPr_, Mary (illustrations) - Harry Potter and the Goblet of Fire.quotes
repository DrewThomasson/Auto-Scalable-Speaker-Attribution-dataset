312	317	304	308	The villagers of Little Hangleton	622	“ the Riddle House , ”
402	405	392	394	The Little Hangletons	171	“ creepy . ”
541	560	521	522	The maid	639	“ Lying there with their eyes wide open ! Cold as ice ! Still in their dinner things ! ”
729	732	734	735	several people	658	“ Frank ! ”
737	740	734	735	several people	658	“ Never ! ”
810	817	818	818	she	665	“ Always thought he was odd , ”
830	864	818	818	she	665	“ Unfriendly , like . I ’m sure if I ’ve offered him a cuppa once , I ’ve offered it a hundred times . Never wanted to mix , he did n’t . ”
865	870	872	876	a woman at the bar	667	“ Ah , now , ”
878	899	872	876	a woman at the bar	667	“ he had a hard war , Frank . He likes the quiet life . That ’s no reason to — ”
900	913	915	916	the cook	665	“ Who else had a key to the back door , then ? ”
918	968	915	916	the cook	665	“ There ’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener ’s cottage far back as I can remember ! Nobody forced the door last night ! No broken windows ! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping . … ”
975	990	992	996	a man at the bar	670	“ I always thought he had a nasty look about him , right enough , ”
998	1009	1011	1012	the landlord	671	“ War turned him funny , if you ask me , ”
1014	1036	1038	1043	an excited woman in the corner	672	“ Told you I would n’t like to get on the wrong side of Frank , did n’t I , Dot ? ”
1045	1049	1051	1051	Dot	177	“ Horrible temper , ”
1056	1066	1051	1051	Dot	177	“ I remember , when he was a kid … ”
1404	1426	1428	1428	Dot	177	“ ’S far as I ’m concerned , he killed them , and I do n’t care what the police say , ”
1434	1456	1428	1428	Dot	177	“ And if he had any decency , he ’d leave here , knowing as how we knows he did it . ”
1556	1560	1546	1546	they	704	“ tax reasons , ”
2299	2318	2284	2285	a man	740	“ There is a little more in the bottle , My Lord , if you are still hungry . ”
2319	2322	2332	2333	a man	740	“ Later , ”
2371	2381	2365	2365	Frank	175	“ Move me closer to the fire , Wormtail . ”
2477	2482	2484	2486	the cold voice	744	“ Where is Nagini ? ”
2488	2499	2501	2503	the first voice	745	“ I — I do n’t know , My Lord , ”
2506	2519	2501	2503	the first voice	745	“ She set out to explore the house , I think . … ”
2520	2531	2533	2535	the second voice	746	“ You will milk her before we retire , Wormtail , ”
2537	2553	2533	2535	the second voice	746	“ I will need feeding in the night . The journey has tired me greatly . ”
2586	2602	2579	2582	the man called Wormtail	747	“ My Lord , may I ask how long we are going to stay here ? ”
2603	2607	2609	2611	the cold voice	744	“ A week , ”
2613	2645	2609	2611	the cold voice	744	“ Perhaps longer . The place is moderately comfortable , and the plan can not proceed yet . It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over . ”
2674	2677	2609	2611	the cold voice	744	“ Quidditch , ”
2686	2697	2699	2699	Wormtail	180	“ The — the Quidditch World Cup , My Lord ? ”
2714	2736	2702	2702	Frank	175	“ Forgive me , but — I do not understand — why should we wait until the World Cup is over ? ”
2737	2804	2704	2704	his	175	“ Because , fool , at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world , and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty , on the watch for signs of unusual activity , checking and double - checking identities . They will be obsessed with security , lest the Muggles notice anything . So we wait . ”
2820	2825	2814	2814	He	175	“ Ministry of Magic , ”
2826	2829	2704	2704	his	175	“ wizards , ”
2831	2834	2814	2814	He	175	“ Muggles . ”
2882	2891	2892	2892	Wormtail	180	“ Your Lordship is still determined , then ? ”
2896	2904	2892	2892	Wormtail	180	“ Certainly I am determined , Wormtail . ”
2951	2963	2938	2938	he	180	“ It could be done without Harry Potter , My Lord . ”
2973	2978	2980	2982	the second voice	746	“ Without Harry Potter ? ”
2985	2989	2980	2982	the second voice	746	“ I see … ”
2990	3006	3008	3008	Wormtail	180	“ My Lord , I do not say this out of concern for the boy ! ”
3015	3092	3008	3008	Wormtail	180	“ The boy is nothing to me , nothing at all ! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard — any wizard — the thing could be done so much more quickly ! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while — you know that I can disguise myself most effectively — I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person — ”
3093	3100	3102	3104	the cold voice	744	“ I could use another wizard , ”
3107	3113	3102	3104	the cold voice	744	“ that is true . … ”
3114	3122	3124	3124	Wormtail	180	“ My Lord , it makes sense , ”
3131	3148	3124	3124	Wormtail	180	“ Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult , he is so well protected — ”
3149	3177	3178	3178	Wormtail	180	“ And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute ? I wonder … perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you , “
3197	3197	3124	3124	Wormtail	180	”
3198	3216	3124	3124	Wormtail	180	“ My Lord ! I — I have no wish to leave you , none at all — ”
3217	3224	3226	3228	the second voice	746	“ Do not lie to me ! ”
3230	3271	3226	3228	the second voice	746	“ I can always tell , Wormtail ! You are regretting that you ever returned to me . I revolt you . I see you flinch when you look at me , feel you shudder when you touch me . … ”
3272	3281	3124	3124	Wormtail	180	“ No ! My devotion to Your Lordship — ”
3282	3326	3226	3228	the second voice	746	“ Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice . You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go . How am I to survive without you , when I need feeding every few hours ? Who is to milk Nagini ? ”
3327	3338	3124	3124	Wormtail	180	“ But you seem so much stronger , My Lord — ”
3339	3342	3344	3346	the second voice	746	“ Liar , ”
3348	3379	3344	3346	the second voice	746	“ I am no stronger , and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care . Silence ! ”
3424	3512	3408	3410	the second man	756	“ I have my reasons for using the boy , as I have already explained to you , and I will use no other . I have waited thirteen years . A few more months will make no difference . As for the protection surrounding the boy , I believe my plan will be effective . All that is needed is a little courage from you , Wormtail — courage you will find , unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldemort ’s wrath — ”
3513	3521	3523	3523	Wormtail	180	“ My Lord , I must speak ! ”
3531	3569	3523	3523	Wormtail	180	“ All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head — My Lord , Bertha Jorkins ’s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long , and if we proceed , if I murder — ”
3570	3573	3575	3577	the second voice	746	“ If ? ”
3579	3664	3575	3577	the second voice	746	“ If ? If you follow the plan , Wormtail , the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died . You will do it quietly and without fuss ; I only wish that I could do it myself , but in my present condition … Come , Wormtail , one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear . I am not asking you to do it alone . By that time , my faithful servant will have rejoined us — ”
3665	3672	3674	3674	Wormtail	180	“ I am a faithful servant , ”
3685	3710	3682	3682	his	180	“ Wormtail , I need somebody with brains , somebody whose loyalty has never wavered , and you , unfortunately , fulfill neither requirement . ”
3711	3716	3718	3718	Wormtail	180	“ I found you , ”
3732	3747	3728	3728	his	180	“ I was the one who found you . I brought you Bertha Jorkins . ”
3748	3753	3755	3757	the second man	756	“ That is true , ”
3762	3802	3755	3757	the second man	756	“ A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you , Wormtail — though , if truth be told , you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her , were you ? ”
3803	3816	3822	3824	the second voice	746	“ I — I thought she might be useful , My Lord — ”
3817	3820	3822	3824	the second voice	746	“ Liar , ”
3835	3898	3822	3824	the second voice	746	“ However , I do not deny that her information was invaluable . Without it , I could never have formed our plan , and for that , you will have your reward , Wormtail . I will allow you to perform an essential task for me , one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform . … ”
3899	3910	3911	3911	Wormtail	180	“ R - really , My Lord ? What — ? ”
3916	3959	3822	3824	the second voice	746	“ Ah , Wormtail , you do n’t want me to spoil the surprise ? Your part will come at the very end … but I promise you , you will have the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins . ”
3960	3965	3966	3966	Wormtail	180	“ You … you … ”
3982	3993	3966	3966	Wormtail	180	“ You … are going … to kill me too ? ”
3994	3999	4001	4003	the cold voice	744	“ Wormtail , Wormtail , ”
4006	4086	4001	4003	the cold voice	744	“ why would I kill you ? I killed Bertha because I had to . She was fit for nothing after my questioning , quite useless . In any case , awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays . Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns . … ”
4117	4164	4102	4104	the second man	756	“ We could have modified her memory ? But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard , as I proved when I questioned her . It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her , Wormtail . ”
4304	4346	4355	4355	He	756	“ One more murder … my faithful servant at Hogwarts … Harry Potter is as good as mine , Wormtail . It is decided . There will be no more argument . But quiet … I think I hear Nagini . … ”
4694	4702	4685	4687	the cold voice	744	“ Nagini has interesting news , Wormtail , ”
4706	4714	4716	4716	Wormtail	180	“ In - indeed , My Lord ? ”
4718	4723	4685	4687	the cold voice	744	“ Indeed , yes , ”
4728	4751	4685	4687	the cold voice	744	“ According to Nagini , there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room , listening to every word we say . ”
4810	4822	4807	4807	his	781	“ Invite him inside , Wormtail . Where are your manners ? ”
4953	4960	4962	4964	the cold voice	744	“ You heard everything , Muggle ? ”
4966	4975	4977	4977	Frank	175	“ What ’s that you ’re calling me ? ”
5014	5022	5024	5025	the voice	789	“ I am calling you a Muggle , ”
5028	5038	5024	5025	the voice	789	“ It means that you are not a wizard . ”
5039	5050	5052	5052	Frank	175	“ I do n’t know what you mean by wizard , ”
5059	5095	5096	5096	he	175	“ All I know is I ’ve heard enough to interest the police tonight , I have . You ’ve done murder and you ’re planning more ! And I ’ll tell you this too , ”
5104	5121	5096	5096	he	175	“ my wife knows I ’m up here , and if I do n’t come back — ”
5122	5128	5130	5132	the cold voice	744	“ You have no wife , ”
5137	5170	5130	5132	the cold voice	744	“ Nobody knows you are here . You told nobody that you were coming . Do not lie to Lord Voldemort , Muggle , for he knows … he always knows . … ”
5171	5176	5178	5178	Frank	175	“ Is that right ? ”
5181	5216	5178	5178	Frank	175	“ Lord , is it ? Well , I do n’t think much of your manners , My Lord . Turn ’ round and face me like a man , why do n’t you ? ”
5217	5227	5130	5132	the cold voice	744	“ But I am not a man , Muggle , ”
5243	5273	5130	5132	the cold voice	744	“ I am much , much more than a man . However … why not ? I will face you . … Wormtail , come turn my chair around . ”
5280	5287	5291	5291	his	791	“ You heard me , Wormtail . ”
7144	7184	7130	7131	Hermione Granger	186	“ Your scar hurt ? Harry , that ’s really serious . … Write to Professor Dumbledore!And I ’ll go and check Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions . … Maybe there ’s something in there about curse scars . … ”
7458	7524	7436	7436	Ron	196	“ Your scar hurt ? But … but You - Know - Who ca n’t be near you now , can he?I mean … you ’d know , would n’t you ? He ’d be trying to do you in again , would n’t he ? I dunno , Harry , maybe curse scars always twinge a bit . … I ’ll ask Dad . … ”
8925	8933	8937	8937	her	191	“ There you are , Diddy darling , ”
9004	9019	9000	9001	Uncle Vernon	190	“ he did n’t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway . ”
9032	9048	9049	9050	Aunt Petunia	191	“ He ’s a boisterous little boy , but he would n’t hurt a fly ! ”
9285	9289	9282	9283	Uncle Vernon	190	“ rabbit food . ”
9630	9635	9636	9636	he	190	“ Is this it ? ”
9826	9829	9830	9830	he	190	“ You , ”
9835	9843	9830	9830	he	190	“ In the living room . Now . ”
9887	9890	9891	9891	he	190	“ So , ”
9915	9918	9891	9891	he	190	“ So . ”
9928	9932	9919	9919	Harry	162	“ So what ? ”
9973	9978	9980	9981	Uncle Vernon	190	“ This just arrived , ”
9994	10001	9983	9983	He	190	“ A letter . About you . ”
10282	10287	10288	10288	he	190	“ Look at this , ”
10345	10355	10357	10357	Harry	162	“ She did put enough stamps on , then , ”
10380	10385	10386	10386	he	190	“ The postman noticed , ”
10392	10421	10386	10386	he	190	“ Very interested to know where this letter came from , he was . That ’s why he rang the doorbell . Seemed to think it was funny . ”
10554	10562	10563	10563	he	162	“ So — can I go then ? ”
10690	10696	10697	10697	he	162	“ Who is this woman ? ”
10707	10713	10715	10715	Harry	162	“ You ’ve seen her , ”
10717	10745	10715	10715	Harry	162	“ She ’s my friend Ron ’s mother , she was meeting him off the Hog — off the school train at the end of last term . ”
10750	10754	10746	10746	He	162	“ Hogwarts Express , ”
10800	10806	10807	10807	he	190	“ Dumpy sort of woman ? ”
10811	10819	10807	10807	he	190	“ Load of children with red hair ? ”
10836	10839	10823	10823	He	162	“ dumpy , ”
10879	10882	10883	10883	he	190	“ Quidditch , ”
10889	10897	10883	10883	he	190	“ Quidditch — what is this rubbish ? ”
10906	10912	10913	10913	he	162	“ It ’s a sport , ”
10917	10922	10913	10913	he	162	“ Played on broom — ”
10923	10930	10932	10933	Uncle Vernon	190	“ All right , all right ! ”
10961	10963	10980	10980	his	190	“ broomsticks ”
10985	10996	10997	10997	He	162	“ send us your answer … in the normal way . ”
11000	11012	11013	11013	he	162	“ What does she mean , ‘ the normal way ’ ? ”
11016	11021	11023	11023	Harry	162	“ Normal for us , ”
11036	11051	11033	11033	he	162	“ you know , owl post . That ’s what ’s normal for wizards . ”
11098	11117	11118	11118	he	190	“ How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof ? ”
11129	11147	11118	11118	he	190	“ You stand there , in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back — ”
11148	11156	11158	11158	Harry	162	“ Only after Dudley finished with them , ”
11207	11217	11219	11220	Uncle Vernon	190	“ I will not be spoken to like that ! ”
11302	11339	11291	11291	Harry	162	“ Okay , I ca n’t see the World Cup . Can I go now , then ? Only I ’ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish . You know — my godfather . ”
11376	11389	11391	11392	Uncle Vernon	190	“ You ’re — you ’re writing to him , are you ? ”
11417	11422	11424	11424	Harry	162	“ Well — yeah , ”
11428	11458	11424	11424	Harry	162	“ It ’s been a while since he heard from me , and , you know , if he does n’t , he might start thinking something ’s wrong . ”
11586	11669	11679	11679	He	162	“ Well , all right then . You can go to this ruddy … this stupid … this World Cup thing . You write and tell these — these Weasleys they ’re to pick you up , mind . I have n’t got time to go dropping you off all over the country . And you can spend the rest of the summer there . And you can tell your — your godfather … tell him … tell him you ’re going . ”
11670	11674	11676	11676	Harry	162	“ Okay then , ”
11762	11773	11775	11775	Harry	162	“ That was an excellent breakfast , was n’t it ? ”
11777	11787	11775	11775	Harry	162	“ I feel really full , do n’t you ? ”
11868	11871	11873	11873	Harry	162	“ OUCH ! ”
12030	12033	12025	12025	Harry	162	“ Pig , ”
12208	12212	12213	12213	Harry	162	“ Calm down ! ”
12245	12258	12213	12213	Harry	162	“ Come here , I need you to take my answer back ! ”
12392	12400	12401	12401	he	162	“ Feeling up to a long journey ? ”
12415	12425	12426	12426	he	162	“ Can you take this to Sirius for me ? ”
12434	12445	12426	12426	he	162	“ Hang on … I just want to finish it . ”
12522	12537	12538	12538	Harry	162	“ I ’ll be at Ron ’s when you get back , all right ? ”
12860	12873	12874	12874	he	190	“ I hope you told them to dress properly , these people , ”
12879	12907	12874	12874	he	190	“ I ’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear . They ’d better have the decency to put on normal clothes , that ’s all . ”
12931	12934	12927	12928	the Dursleys	192	“ normal . ”
13215	13224	13225	13226	Uncle Vernon	190	“ They ’ll be driving , of course ? ”
13232	13235	13237	13237	Harry	162	“ Er , ”
13304	13309	13311	13311	Harry	162	“ I think so , ”
13559	13564	13565	13565	he	190	“ They ’re late ! ”
13570	13574	13576	13576	Harry	162	“ I know , ”
13578	13591	13576	13576	Harry	162	“ Maybe — er — the traffic ’s bad , or something . ”
13631	13637	13681	13681	him	190	“ No consideration at all . ”
13638	13646	13681	13681	him	190	“ We might ’ve had an engagement . ”
13647	13662	13681	13681	him	190	“ Maybe they think they ’ll get invited to dinner if they ’re late . ”
13663	13673	13675	13676	Uncle Vernon	190	“ Well , they most certainly wo n’t be , ”
13691	13750	13681	13681	him	190	“ They ’ll take the boy and go , there ’ll be no hanging around . That ’s if they ’re coming at all . Probably mistaken the day . I daresay their kind do n’t set much store by punctuality . Either that or they drive some tin - pot car that ’s broken d — AAAAAAAARRRRRGH ! ”
13793	13797	13799	13799	Harry	162	“ What happened ? ”
13801	13807	13799	13799	Harry	162	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
13870	13875	13877	13878	Aunt Petunia	191	“ What is it ? ”
13896	13903	13877	13878	Aunt Petunia	191	“ What is it , Vernon ? ”
13925	13969	14087	14087	He	162	“ Ouch ! Fred , no — go back , go back , there ’s been some kind of mistake — tell George not to — OUCH ! George , no , there ’s no room , go back quickly and tell Ron — ”
13970	13989	14087	14087	He	162	“ Maybe Harry can hear us , Dad — maybe he ’ll be able to let us out — ”
14005	14015	14087	14087	He	162	“ Harry ? Harry , can you hear us ? ”
14028	14033	14035	14036	Uncle Vernon	190	“ What is this ? ”
14038	14044	14035	14036	Uncle Vernon	190	“ What ’s going on ? ”
14045	14058	14060	14060	Harry	162	“ They — they ’ve tried to get here by Floo powder , ”
14069	14086	14060	14060	Harry	162	“ They can travel by fire — only you ’ve blocked the fireplace — hang on — ”
14097	14106	14087	14087	He	162	“ Mr. Weasley ? Can you hear me ? ”
14118	14121	14111	14115	Somebody inside the chimney piece	986	“ Shh ! ”
14122	14147	14087	14087	He	162	“ Mr. Weasley , it ’s Harry … the fireplace has been blocked up . You wo n’t be able to get through there . ”
14148	14151	14153	14154	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Damn ! ”
14158	14172	14153	14154	Mr. Weasley	198	“ What on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for ? ”
14173	14181	14182	14182	Harry	162	“ They ’ve got an electric fire , ”
14185	14188	14190	14191	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Really ? ”
14196	14222	14190	14191	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Eclectic , you say ? With a plug ? Gracious , I must see that . … Let ’s think … ouch , Ron ! ”
14232	14244	14223	14223	Ron	196	“ What are we doing here ? Has something gone wrong ? ”
14245	14251	14253	14253	Fred	200	“ Oh no , Ron , ”
14260	14273	14253	14253	Fred	200	“ No , this is exactly where we wanted to end up . ”
14274	14287	14289	14289	George	201	“ Yeah , we ’re having the time of our lives here , ”
14305	14310	14312	14313	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Boys , boys … ”
14316	14337	14312	14313	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I ’m trying to think what to do . … Yes … only way … Stand back , Harry . ”
14352	14357	14358	14358	he	190	“ Wait a moment ! ”
14364	14372	14358	14358	he	190	“ What exactly are you going to — ”
14461	14466	14468	14469	Mr. Weasley	198	“ That ’s better , ”
14483	14495	14468	14469	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Ah — you must be Harry ’s aunt and uncle ! ”
14561	14570	14572	14573	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Er — yes — sorry about that , ”
14588	14711	14576	14576	his	198	“ It ’s all my fault . It just did n’t occur to me that we would n’t be able to get out at the other end . I had your fireplace connected to the Floo Network , you see — just for an afternoon , you know , so we could get Harry . Muggle fireplaces are n’t supposed to be connected , strictly speaking — but I ’ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me . I can put it right in a jiffy , though , do n’t worry . I ’ll light a fire to send the boys back , and then I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate . ”
14750	14755	14757	14758	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Hello , Harry ! ”
14761	14767	14757	14758	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Got your trunk ready ? ”
14768	14773	14775	14775	Harry	162	“ It ’s upstairs , ”
14780	14786	14788	14788	Fred	200	“ We ’ll get it , ”
14847	14850	14856	14856	his	198	“ Well , ”
14873	14886	14861	14861	he	198	“ Very — erm — very nice place you ’ve got here . ”
14973	14982	14983	14983	he	198	“ They run off eckeltricity , do they ? ”
14987	15001	15002	15002	he	198	“ Ah yes , I can see the plugs . I collect plugs , ”
15008	15032	15002	15002	he	198	“ And batteries . Got a very large collection of batteries . My wife thinks I ’m mad , but there you are . ”
15152	15165	15167	15168	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Ah , this is your cousin , is it , Harry ? ”
15178	15181	15183	15183	Harry	162	“ Yep , ”
15185	15190	15183	15183	Harry	162	“ that ’s Dudley . ”
15286	15294	15295	15295	he	198	“ Having a good holiday , Dudley ? ”
15346	15351	15353	15354	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Ah , right , ”
15356	15362	15353	15354	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Better get cracking then . ”
15389	15392	15394	15395	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Incendio ! ”
15467	15475	15477	15478	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Off you go then , Fred , ”
15480	15483	15485	15485	Fred	200	“ Coming , ”
15487	15494	15485	15485	Fred	200	“ Oh no — hang on — ”
15555	15559	15560	15561	Aunt Petunia	191	“ the Burrow ! ”
15578	15584	15586	15587	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Right then , George , ”

15750	15759	15760	15760	he	198	“ Harry said good - bye to you , ”
15763	15770	15760	15760	he	198	“ Did n’t you hear him ? ”
15771	15777	15778	15778	Harry	162	“ It does n’t matter , ”
15784	15792	15778	15778	Harry	162	“ Honestly , I do n’t care . ”
15805	15818	15819	15819	he	198	“ You are n’t going to see your nephew till next summer , ”
15828	15839	15819	15819	he	198	“ Surely you ’re going to say good - bye ? ”
15903	15910	15897	15897	he	190	“ Good - bye , then . ”
15911	15915	15917	15917	Harry	162	“ See you , ”
16097	16108	16109	16109	he	198	“ Not to worry , I can sort him out ! ”
16141	16146	16148	16149	Mr. Weasley	198	“ No , really ! ”
16152	16195	16148	16149	Mr. Weasley	198	“ It ’s a simple process — it was the toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it ’s only an Engorgement Charm — at least , I think it is — please , I can correct it — ”
16286	16290	16292	16293	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Now really ! ”
16300	16307	16292	16293	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I ’m trying to help ! ”
16321	16329	16330	16331	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Harry , go ! Just go ! ”
16340	16347	16330	16331	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I ’ll sort this out ! ”
16397	16401	16395	16395	he	162	“ the Burrow ! ”
16555	16561	16563	16563	Fred	200	“ Did he eat it ? ”
16577	16580	16582	16582	Harry	162	“ Yeah , ”
16587	16592	16582	16582	Harry	162	“ What was it ? ”
16593	16599	16601	16601	Fred	200	“ Ton - Tongue Toffee , ”
16604	16626	16601	16601	Fred	200	“ George and I invented them , and we ’ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer . … ”
16681	16689	16694	16695	the two	1011	“ How ’re you doing , Harry ? ”
16986	16994	16995	16995	he	198	“ That was n’t funny , Fred ! ”
16998	17009	16995	16995	he	198	“ What on earth did you give that Muggle boy ? ”
17010	17018	17020	17020	Fred	200	“ I did n’t give him anything , ”
17027	17050	17020	17020	Fred	200	“ I just dropped it . … It was his fault he went and ate it , I never told him to . ”
17051	17058	17060	17061	Mr. Weasley	198	“ You dropped it on purpose ! ”
17063	17079	17060	17061	Mr. Weasley	198	“ You knew he ’d eat it , you knew he was on a diet — ”
17080	17088	17089	17089	George	201	“ How big did his tongue get ? ”
17093	17108	17060	17061	Mr. Weasley	198	“ It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it ! ”
17118	17124	17125	17126	Mr. Weasley	198	“ It is n’t funny ! ”
17129	17158	17125	17126	Mr. Weasley	198	“ That sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard – Muggle relations ! I spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of Muggles , and my own sons — ”
17159	17173	17175	17175	Fred	200	“ We did n’t give it to him because he ’s a Muggle ! ”
17178	17194	17196	17196	George	201	“ No , we gave it to him because he ’s a great bullying git , ”
17198	17205	17196	17196	George	201	“ Is n’t he , Harry ? ”
17206	17215	17217	17217	Harry	162	“ Yeah , he is , Mr. Weasley , ”
17220	17227	17229	17230	Mr. Weasley	198	“ That ’s not the point ! ”
17232	17241	17229	17230	Mr. Weasley	198	“ You wait until I tell your mother — ”
17242	17247	17262	17262	She	199	“ Tell me what ? ”
17284	17292	17293	17293	she	199	“ Oh hello , Harry , dear , ”
17310	17317	17302	17302	her	199	“ Tell me what , Arthur ? ”
17450	17457	17458	17459	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Tell me what , Arthur ? ”
17469	17476	17478	17479	Mr. Weasley	198	“ It ’s nothing , Molly , ”
17481	17495	17478	17479	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Fred and George just — but I ’ve had words with them — ”
17496	17504	17506	17507	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ What have they done this time ? ”
17509	17523	17506	17507	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ If it ’s got anything to do with Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes — ”
17524	17538	17540	17540	Hermione	186	“ Why do n’t you show Harry where he ’s sleeping , Ron ? ”
17545	17553	17555	17555	Ron	196	“ He knows where he ’s sleeping , ”
17557	17567	17555	17555	Ron	196	“ in my room , he slept there last — ”
17568	17574	17576	17576	Hermione	186	“ We can all go , ”
17579	17582	17584	17584	Ron	196	“ Oh , ”
17589	17592	17584	17584	Ron	196	“ Right . ”
17593	17601	17603	17603	George	201	“ Yeah , we ’ll come too , ”
17605	17612	17614	17615	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ You stay where you are ! ”
17654	17662	17663	17663	Harry	162	“ What are Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes ? ”
17680	17698	17700	17700	Ron	196	“ Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George ’s room , ”
17703	17744	17700	17700	Ron	196	“ Great long price lists for stuff they ’ve invented . Joke stuff , you know . Fake wands and trick sweets , loads of stuff . It was brilliant , I never knew they ’d been inventing all that … ”
17745	17768	17770	17770	Ginny	222	“ We ’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages , but we never thought they were actually making things , ”
17772	17781	17770	17770	Ginny	222	“ We thought they just liked the noise . ”
17782	17803	17805	17805	Ron	196	“ Only , most of the stuff — well , all of it , really — was a bit dangerous , ”
17807	17872	17805	17805	Ron	196	“ and , you know , they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money , and Mum went mad at them . Told them they were n’t allowed to make any more of it , and burned all the order forms . … She ’s furious at them anyway . They did n’t get as many O.W.L.s as she expected . ”
17890	17899	17900	17900	Ginny	222	“ And then there was this big row , ”
17903	17933	17900	17900	Ginny	222	“ because Mum wants them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad , and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop . ”
17960	17965	17967	17967	Harry	162	“ Hi , Percy , ”
17969	17975	17977	17977	Percy	214	“ Oh hello , Harry , ”
17979	18029	17977	17977	Percy	214	“ I was wondering who was making all the noise . I ’m trying to work in here , you know — I ’ve got a report to finish for the office — and it ’s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs . ”
18030	18036	18038	18038	Ron	196	“ We ’re not thundering , ”
18041	18062	18038	18038	Ron	196	“ We ’re walking . Sorry if we ’ve disturbed the top - secret workings of the Ministry of Magic . ”
18063	18070	18072	18072	Harry	162	“ What are you working on ? ”
18074	18085	18087	18087	Percy	214	“ A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation , ”
18090	18125	18087	18087	Percy	214	“ We ’re trying to standardize cauldron thickness . Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin — leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year — ”
18126	18137	18139	18139	Ron	196	“ That ’ll change the world , that report will , ”
18141	18155	18139	18139	Ron	196	“ Front page of the Daily Prophet , I expect , cauldron leaks . ”
18161	18168	18169	18169	he	214	“ You might sneer , Ron , ”
18173	18201	18169	18169	he	214	“ but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy , shallow - bottomed products that seriously endanger — ”
18202	18210	18212	18212	Ron	196	“ Yeah , yeah , all right , ”
18387	18393	18395	18395	Ron	196	“ Shut up , Pig , ”
18414	18433	18434	18434	he	196	“ Fred and George are in here with us , because Bill and Charlie are in their room , ”
18438	18455	18434	18434	he	196	“ Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he ’s got to work . ”
18456	18467	18468	18468	Harry	162	“ Er — why are you calling that owl Pig ? ”
18472	18479	18481	18481	Ginny	222	“ Because he ’s being stupid , ”
18483	18490	18481	18481	Ginny	222	“ Its proper name is Pigwidgeon . ”
18491	18504	18506	18506	Ron	196	“ Yeah , and that ’s not a stupid name at all , ”
18509	18514	18515	18515	he	196	“ Ginny named him , ”
18520	18578	18515	18515	he	196	“ She reckons it ’s sweet . And I tried to change it , but it was too late , he wo n’t answer to anything else . So now he ’s Pig . I ’ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes . He annoys me too , come to that . ”
18628	18633	18634	18634	Harry	162	“ Where ’s Crookshanks ? ”
18639	18648	18649	18649	she	186	“ Out in the garden , I expect , ”
18652	18665	18649	18649	she	186	“ He likes chasing gnomes . He ’s never seen any before . ”
18666	18674	18676	18676	Harry	162	“ Percy ’s enjoying work , then ? ”
18701	18705	18707	18707	Ron	196	“ Enjoying it ? ”
18710	18778	18707	18707	Ron	196	“ I do n’t reckon he ’d come home if Dad did n’t make him . He ’s obsessed . Just do n’t get him onto the subject of his boss . According to Mr. Crouch … as I was saying to Mr. Crouch … Mr. Crouch is of the opinion … Mr. Crouch was telling me … They ’ll be announcing their engagement any day now . ”
18779	18789	18791	18791	Hermione	186	“ Have you had a good summer , Harry ? ”
18793	18803	18791	18791	Hermione	186	“ Did you get our food parcels and everything ? ”
18804	18811	18813	18813	Harry	162	“ Yeah , thanks a lot , ”
18815	18824	18813	18813	Harry	162	“ They saved my life , those cakes . ”
18825	18833	18834	18834	Ron	196	“ And have you heard from — ? ”
18921	18929	18931	18931	Hermione	186	“ I think they ’ve stopped arguing , ”
18949	18961	18940	18940	Ginny	222	“ Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner ? ”
18962	18968	18970	18970	Ron	196	“ Yeah , all right , ”
18999	19008	19009	19009	she	199	“ We ’re eating out in the garden , ”
19016	19055	19056	19056	she	199	“ There ’s just not room for eleven people in here . Could you take the plates outside , girls ? Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables . Knives and forks , please , you two , ”
19100	19107	19108	19108	she	199	“ Oh for heaven ’s sake , ”
19136	19140	19141	19141	she	199	“ Those two ! ”
19165	19199	19141	19141	she	199	“ I do n’t know what ’s going to happen to them , I really do n’t . No ambition , unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can . … ”
19234	19246	19247	19247	she	199	“ It ’s not as though they have n’t got brains , ”
19269	19330	19247	19247	she	199	“ but they ’re wasting them , and unless they pull themselves together soon , they ’ll be in real trouble . I ’ve had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together . If they carry on the way they ’re going , they ’ll end up in front of the Improper Use of Magic Office . ”
19386	19398	19405	19405	her	199	“ I do n’t know where we went wrong with them , ”
19416	19441	19405	19405	her	199	“ It ’s been the same for years , one thing after another , and they wo n’t listen to — OH NOT AGAIN ! ”
19467	19475	19476	19476	she	199	“ One of their fake wands again ! ”
19479	19494	19476	19476	she	199	“ How many times have I told them not to leave them lying around ? ”
19514	19518	19519	19519	Ron	196	“ C’m on , ”
19535	19545	19519	19519	Ron	196	“ let ’s go and help Bill and Charlie . ”
19810	19818	19819	19819	he	214	“ Will you keep it down ? ! ”
19822	19827	19829	19829	Bill	219	“ Sorry , Perce , ”
19833	19842	19829	19829	Bill	219	“ How ’re the cauldron bottoms coming on ? ”
19843	19847	19849	19849	Percy	214	“ Very badly , ”
20006	20021	20022	20022	Percy	214	“ I ’ve told Mr. Crouch that I ’ll have it ready by Tuesday , ”
20027	20106	20022	20022	Percy	214	“ That ’s a bit sooner than he expected it , but I like to keep on top of things . I think he ’ll be grateful I ’ve done it in good time , I mean , it ’s extremely busy in our department just now , what with all the arrangements for the World Cup . We ’re just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports . Ludo Bagman — ”
20107	20112	20114	20115	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I like Ludo , ”
20118	20167	20114	20115	Mr. Weasley	198	“ He was the one who got us such good tickets for the Cup . I did him a bit of a favor : His brother , Otto , got into a spot of trouble — a lawnmower with unnatural powers — I smoothed the whole thing over . ”
20168	20178	20180	20180	Percy	214	“ Oh Bagman ’s likable enough , of course , ”
20183	20250	20180	20180	Percy	214	“ but how he ever got to be Head of Department … when I compare him to Mr. Crouch ! I ca n’t see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out what ’s happened to them . You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a month now ? Went on holiday to Albania and never came back ? ”
20251	20261	20263	20264	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Yes , I was asking Ludo about that , ”
20268	20300	20263	20264	Mr. Weasley	198	“ He says Bertha ’s gotten lost plenty of times before now — though I must say , if it was someone in my department , I ’d be worried . … ”
20301	20310	20312	20312	Percy	214	“ Oh Bertha ’s hopeless , all right , ”
20314	20404	20312	20312	Percy	214	“ I hear she ’s been shunted from department to department for years , much more trouble than she ’s worth … but all the same , Bagman ought to be trying to find her . Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest , she worked in our department at one time , you know , and I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her — but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania . However ”
20420	20464	20406	20406	Percy	214	“ we ’ve got quite enough on our plates at the Department of International Magical Cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too . As you know , we ’ve got another big event to organize right after the World Cup . ”
20489	20501	20502	20502	He	214	“ You know the one I ’m talking about , Father . ”
20508	20515	20504	20504	his	214	“ The top - secret one . ”
20527	20556	20516	20516	Ron	196	“ He ’s been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work . Probably an exhibition of thick - bottomed cauldrons . ”
20582	20604	20564	20565	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ … with a horrible great fang on it . Really , Bill , what do they say at the bank ? ”
20605	20629	20631	20631	Bill	219	“ Mum , no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure , ”
20634	20644	20646	20647	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ And your hair ’s getting silly , dear , ”
20654	20667	20650	20650	her	199	“ I wish you ’d let me give it a trim . … ”
20668	20673	20675	20675	Ginny	222	“ I like it , ”
20683	20707	20675	20675	Ginny	222	“ You ’re so old - fashioned , Mum . Anyway , it ’s nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore ’s . … ”
20728	20736	20738	20738	Charlie	220	“ It ’s got to be Ireland , ”
20747	20755	20738	20738	Charlie	220	“ They flattened Peru in the semifinals . ”
20756	20765	20767	20767	Fred	200	“ Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum , though , ”
20769	20781	20783	20783	Charlie	220	“ Krum ’s one decent player , Ireland has got seven , ”
20786	20801	20783	20783	Charlie	220	“ I wish England had got through . That was embarrassing , that was . ”
20802	20806	20808	20808	Harry	162	“ What happened ? ”
20829	20842	20844	20844	Charlie	220	“ Went down to Transylvania , three hundred and ninety to ten , ”
20847	20864	20844	20844	Charlie	220	“ Shocking performance . And Wales lost to Uganda , and Scotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg . ”
21030	21040	21023	21023	he	196	“ So — have you heard from Sirius lately ? ”
21048	21051	21053	21053	Harry	162	“ Yeah , ”
21056	21078	21053	21053	Harry	162	“ twice . He sounds okay . I wrote to him yesterday . He might write back while I ’m here . ”
21141	21147	21154	21154	her	199	“ Look at the time , ”
21157	21235	21148	21149	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ You really should be in bed , the whole lot of you — you ’ll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup . Harry , if you leave your school list out , I ’ll get your things for you tomorrow in Diagon Alley . I ’m getting everyone else ’s . There might not be time after the World Cup , the match went on for five days last time . ”
21236	21245	21247	21247	Harry	162	“ Wow — hope it does this time ! ”
21250	21258	21260	21260	Percy	214	“ Well , I certainly do n’t , ”
21263	21288	21260	21260	Percy	214	“ I shudder to think what the state of my in - tray would be if I was away from work for five days . ”
21289	21305	21307	21307	Fred	200	“ Yeah , someone might slip dragon dung in it again , eh , Perce ? ”
21309	21319	21321	21321	Percy	214	“ That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway ! ”
21330	21336	21321	21321	Percy	214	“ It was nothing personal ! ”
21337	21341	21342	21342	Fred	200	“ It was , ”
21354	21359	21342	21342	Fred	200	“ We sent it . ”
21389	21398	21399	21399	she	199	“ Time to go , Harry , dear , ”
21458	21464	21466	21466	Fred	200	“ ’S ’ time already ? ”
21579	21584	21585	21585	he	198	“ What d’you think ? ”
21589	21606	21585	21585	he	198	“ We ’re supposed to go incognito — do I look like a Muggle , Harry ? ”
21607	21610	21612	21612	Harry	162	“ Yeah , ”
21616	21620	21612	21612	Harry	162	“ very good . ”
21621	21634	21636	21636	George	201	“ Where ’re Bill and Charlie and Per - Per - Percy ? ”
21645	21656	21658	21659	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Well , they ’re Apparating , are n’t they ? ”
21677	21690	21658	21659	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ So they can have a bit of a lie - in . ”
21726	21734	21736	21736	Fred	200	“ So they ’re still in bed ? ”
21747	21755	21736	21736	Fred	200	“ Why ca n’t we Apparate too ? ”
21756	21771	21773	21774	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Because you ’re not of age and you have n’t passed your test , ”
21776	21785	21773	21774	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ And where have those girls got to ? ”
21800	21810	21811	21811	Harry	162	“ You have to pass a test to Apparate ? ”
21814	21818	21820	21821	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Oh yes , ”
21835	21889	21820	21821	Mr. Weasley	198	“ The Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for Apparating without a license . It ’s not easy , Apparition , and when it ’s not done properly it can lead to nasty complications . This pair I ’m talking about went and splinched themselves . ”
21898	21903	21905	21905	Harry	162	“ Er — splinched ? ”
21907	21915	21917	21918	Mr. Weasley	198	“ They left half of themselves behind , ”
21930	21988	21917	21918	Mr. Weasley	198	“ So , of course , they were stuck . Could n’t move either way . Had to wait for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort them out . Meant a fair old bit of paperwork , I can tell you , what with the Muggles who spotted the body parts they ’d left behind . … ”
22011	22016	22017	22017	he	162	“ Were they okay ? ”
22022	22026	22028	22029	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Oh yes , ”
22036	22088	22028	22029	Mr. Weasley	198	“ But they got a heavy fine , and I do n’t think they ’ll be trying it again in a hurry . You do n’t mess around with Apparition . There are plenty of adult wizards who do n’t bother with it . Prefer brooms — slower , but safer . ”
22089	22101	22162	22163	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it ? ”
22102	22111	22113	22113	Fred	200	“ Charlie had to take the test twice , ”
22117	22148	22113	22113	Fred	200	“ He failed the first time , Apparated five miles south of where he meant to , right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping , remember ? ”
22149	22160	22162	22163	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Yes , well , he passed the second time , ”
22174	22182	22184	22184	George	201	“ Percy only passed two weeks ago , ”
22186	22202	22184	22184	George	201	“ He ’s been Apparating downstairs every morning since , just to prove he can . ”
22224	22235	22236	22236	Ginny	222	“ Why do we have to be up so early ? ”
22249	22259	22261	22262	Mr. Weasley	198	“ We ’ve got a bit of a walk , ”
22264	22267	22269	22269	Harry	162	“ Walk ? ”
22271	22282	22269	22269	Harry	162	“ What , are we walking to the World Cup ? ”
22283	22293	22295	22296	Mr. Weasley	198	“ No , no , that ’s miles away , ”
22300	22358	22295	22296	Mr. Weasley	198	“ We only need to walk a short way . It ’s just that it ’s very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle attention . We have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times , and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World Cup — ”
22359	22362	22364	22365	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ George ! ”
22373	22376	22378	22378	George	201	“ What ? ”
22388	22396	22295	22296	Mr. Weasley	198	“ What is that in your pocket ? ”
22397	22400	22413	22413	her	199	“ Nothing ! ”
22401	22409	22295	22296	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Do n’t you lie to me ! ”
22422	22425	22413	22413	her	199	“ Accio ! ”
22459	22467	22469	22470	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ We told you to destroy them ! ”
22484	22506	22479	22482	Ton - Tongue Toffees	237	“ We told you to get rid of the lot ! Empty your pockets , go on , both of you ! ”
22549	22556	22557	22557	she	199	“ Accio ! Accio ! Accio ! ”
22587	22595	22596	22596	Fred	200	“ We spent six months developing those ! ”
22608	22618	22619	22619	she	199	“ Oh a fine way to spend six months ! ”
22622	22632	22619	22619	she	199	“ No wonder you did n’t get more O.W.L.s ! ”
22690	22698	22700	22701	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Well , have a lovely time , ”
22703	22708	22709	22709	she	199	“ and behave yourselves , ”
22727	22741	22709	22709	she	199	“ I ’ll send Bill , Charlie , and Percy along around midday , ”
22824	22837	22838	22838	he	162	“ So how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing ? ”
22841	22850	22852	22853	Mr. Weasley	198	“ It ’s been a massive organizational problem , ”
22855	23131	22852	22853	Mr. Weasley	198	“ The trouble is , about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup , and of course , we just have n’t got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all . There are places Muggles ca n’t penetrate , but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three - quarters . So we had to find a nice deserted moor , and set up as many anti - Muggle precautions as possible . The whole Ministry ’s been working on it for months . First , of course , we have to stagger the arrivals . People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand . A limited number use Muggle transport , but we ca n’t have too many clogging up their buses and trains — remember , wizards are coming from all over the world . Some Apparate , of course , but we have to set up safe points for them to appear , well away from Muggles . I believe there ’s a handy wood they ’re using as the Apparition point . For those who do n’t want to Apparate , or ca n’t , we use Portkeys . They ’re objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time . You can do large groups at a time if you need to . There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain , and the nearest one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill , so that ’s where we ’re headed . ”
23153	23161	23163	23163	Harry	162	“ What sort of objects are Portkeys ? ”
23166	23174	23176	23177	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Well , they can be anything , ”
23179	23207	23176	23177	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Unobtrusive things , obviously , so Muggles do n’t go picking them up and playing with them … stuff they ’ll just think is litter . … ”
23325	23328	23330	23331	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Whew , ”
23344	23360	23330	23331	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Well , we ’ve made good time — we ’ve got ten minutes . … ”
23378	23386	23388	23389	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Now we just need the Portkey , ”
23401	23412	23388	23389	Mr. Weasley	198	“ It wo n’t be big . … Come on … ”
23441	23457	23485	23485	he	198	“ Over here , Arthur ! Over here , son , we ’ve got it ! ”
23475	23478	23485	23485	he	198	“ Amos ! ”
23532	23540	23542	23543	Mr. Weasley	198	“ This is Amos Diggory , everyone , ”
23545	23570	23542	23543	Mr. Weasley	198	“ He works for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures . And I think you know his son , Cedric ? ”
23596	23599	23601	23601	Cedric	247	“ Hi , ”
23645	23651	23652	23652	Cedric	247	“ Long walk , Arthur ? ”
23657	23662	23664	23665	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Not too bad , ”
23667	23682	23664	23665	Mr. Weasley	198	“ We live just on the other side of the village there . You ? ”
23683	23750	23751	23752	Amos Diggory	239	“ Had to get up at two , did n’t we , Ced ? I tell you , I ’ll be glad when he ’s got his Apparition test . Still … not complaining … Quidditch World Cup , would n’t miss it for a sackful of Galleons — and the tickets cost about that . Mind you , looks like I got off easy . … ”
23771	23778	23769	23769	Ginny	222	“ All these yours , Arthur ? ”
23779	23787	23789	23790	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Oh no , only the redheads , ”
23797	23813	23789	23790	Mr. Weasley	198	“ This is Hermione , friend of Ron ’s — and Harry , another friend — ”
23814	23819	23821	23822	Amos Diggory	239	“ Merlin ’s beard , ”
23828	23834	23824	23824	his	239	“ Harry ? Harry Potter ? ”
23835	23840	23842	23842	Harry	162	“ Er — yeah , ”
23883	23893	23895	23896	Amos Diggory	239	“ Ced ’s talked about you , of course , ”
23898	23938	23895	23896	Amos Diggory	239	“ Told us all about playing against you last year . … I said to him , I said — Ced , that ’ll be something to tell your grandchildren , that will . … You beat Harry Potter ! ”
23967	23976	23977	23977	he	247	“ Harry fell off his broom , Dad , ”
23980	23991	23977	23977	he	247	“ I told you … it was an accident . … ”
23992	24005	24007	24007	Amos	239	“ Yes , but you did n’t fall off , did you ? ”
24017	24075	24007	24007	Amos	239	“ Always modest , our Ced , always the gentleman … but the best man won , I ’m sure Harry’d say the same , would n’t you , eh ? One falls off his broom , one stays on , you do n’t need to be a genius to tell which one ’s the better flier ! ”
24076	24082	24084	24085	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Must be nearly time , ”
24094	24108	24090	24090	his	198	“ Do you know whether we ’re waiting for any more , Amos ? ”
24109	24129	24131	24132	Mr. Diggory	247	“ No , the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts could n’t get tickets , ”
24134	24149	24131	24132	Mr. Diggory	247	“ There are n’t any more of us in this area , are there ? ”
24150	24157	24159	24160	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Not that I know of , ”
24162	24179	24159	24160	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Yes , it ’s a minute off . … We ’d better get ready . … ”
24188	24206	24180	24180	He	198	“ You just need to touch the Portkey , that ’s all , a finger will do — ”
24294	24297	24299	24300	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Three … ”
24309	24314	24299	24300	Mr. Weasley	198	“ two … one … ”
24449	24457	24471	24471	Ron	196	“ Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill , ”
24563	24568	24570	24571	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Morning , Basil , ”
24615	24621	24623	24623	Basil	249	“ Hello there , Arthur , ”
24626	24689	24623	24623	Basil	249	“ Not on duty , eh ? It ’s all right for some . … We ’ve been here all night . … You ’d better get out of the way , we ’ve got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five - fifteen . Hang on , I ’ll find your campsite . … Weasley … Weasley … ”
24696	24731	24690	24690	He	249	“ About a quarter of a mile ’s walk over there , first field you come to . Site manager ’s called Mr. Roberts . Diggory … second field … ask for Mr. Payne . ”
24732	24737	24743	24743	he	198	“ Thanks , Basil , ”
24878	24881	24883	24884	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Morning ! ”
24887	24890	24892	24893	the Muggle	186	“ Morning , ”

24903	24909	24911	24912	Mr. Roberts	250	“ Aye , I would , ”
24914	24920	24911	24912	Mr. Roberts	250	“ And who ’re you ? ”
24921	24934	24866	24866	their	1143	“ Weasley — two tents , booked a couple of days ago ? ”
24935	24938	24940	24941	Mr. Roberts	250	“ Aye , ”
24951	24968	24940	24941	Mr. Roberts	250	“ You ’ve got a space up by the wood there . Just the one night ? ”
24969	24974	24976	24977	Mr. Weasley	198	“ That ’s it , ”
24979	24988	24990	24991	Mr. Roberts	250	“ You ’ll be paying now , then ? ”
24993	25000	25002	25003	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Ah — right — certainly — ”
25019	25025	25026	25026	he	198	“ Help me , Harry , ”
25046	25076	25026	25026	he	198	“ This one ’s a — a — a ten ? Ah yes , I see the little number on it now . … So this is a five ? ”
25077	25081	25082	25082	Harry	248	“ A twenty , ”
25100	25120	25026	25026	he	198	“ Ah yes , so it is . … I do n’t know , these little bits of paper … ”
25121	25125	25127	25128	Mr. Roberts	250	“ You foreign ? ”
25138	25141	25143	25144	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Foreign ? ”
25148	25162	25164	25165	Mr. Roberts	250	“ You ’re not the first one who ’s had trouble with money , ”
25172	25192	25168	25169	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago . ”
25193	25198	25200	25201	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Did you really ? ”
25215	25221	25222	25222	he	250	“ Never been this crowded , ”
25234	25248	25222	25222	he	250	“ Hundreds of pre - bookings . People usually just turn up . … ”
25249	25254	25256	25257	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Is that right ? ”
25277	25280	25281	25281	he	250	“ Aye , ”
25285	25319	25281	25281	he	250	“ People from all over . Loads of foreigners . And not just foreigners . Weirdos , you know ? There ’s a bloke walking ’ round in a kilt and a poncho . ”
25320	25325	25327	25328	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Should n’t he ? ”
25331	25348	25350	25351	Mr. Roberts	250	“ It ’s like some sort of … I dunno … like some sort of rally , ”
25353	25367	25350	25351	Mr. Roberts	250	“ They all seem to know each other . Like a big party . ”
25391	25394	25395	25395	he	1155	“ Obliviate ! ”
25446	25455	25456	25457	Mr. Roberts	250	“ A map of the campsite for you , ”
25464	25469	25456	25457	Mr. Roberts	250	“ And your change . ”
25470	25475	25477	25478	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Thanks very much , ”
25529	25599	25523	25523	he	250	“ Been having a lot of trouble with him . Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy . And Ludo Bagman ’s not helping . Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice , not a worry about anti - Muggle security . Blimey , I ’ll be glad when this is over . See you later , Arthur . ”
25603	25616	25618	25618	Ginny	222	“ I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports , ”
25623	25640	25618	25618	Ginny	222	“ He should know better than to talk about Bludgers near Muggles , should n’t he ? ”
25641	25645	25647	25648	Mr. Weasley	198	“ He should , ”
25662	25714	25647	25648	Mr. Weasley	198	“ but Ludo ’s always been a bit … well … lax about security . You could n’t wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though . He played Quidditch for England himself , you know . And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had . ”
25852	25857	25859	25860	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Always the same , ”
25864	25888	25859	25860	Mr. Weasley	198	“ We ca n’t resist showing off when we get together . Ah , here we are , look , this is us . ”
25924	25932	25934	25935	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Could n’t have a better spot ! ”
25938	25961	25962	25962	He	198	“ The field is just on the other side of the wood there , we ’re as close as we could be . ”
25970	25973	25974	25974	he	198	“ Right , ”
25978	26035	25974	25974	he	198	“ no magic allowed , strictly speaking , not when we ’re out in these numbers on Muggle land . We ’ll be putting these tents up by hand ! Should n’t be too difficult . … Muggles do it all the time . … Here , Harry , where do you reckon we should start ? ”
26203	26211	26212	26212	he	198	“ We ’ll be a bit cramped , ”
26215	26231	26212	26212	he	198	“ but I think we ’ll all squeeze in . Come and have a look . ”
26305	26314	26320	26320	his	198	“ Well , it ’s not for long , ”
26340	26364	26320	26320	his	198	“ I borrowed this from Perkins at the office . Does n’t camp much anymore , poor fellow , he ’s got lumbago . ”
26376	26383	26365	26365	He	198	“ We ’ll need water . … ”
26384	26398	26400	26400	Ron	196	“ There ’s a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us , ”
26419	26430	26400	26400	Ron	196	“ It ’s on the other side of the field . ”
26431	26450	26452	26453	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Well , why do n’t you , Harry , and Hermione go and get us some water then ”
26464	26478	26452	26453	Mr. Weasley	198	“ and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire ? ”
26479	26487	26489	26489	Ron	196	“ But we ’ve got an oven , ”
26491	26498	26489	26489	Ron	196	“ Why ca n’t we just — ”
26499	26507	26509	26510	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Ron , anti - Muggle security ! ”
26518	26537	26512	26512	his	198	“ When real Muggles camp , they cook on fires outdoors . I ’ve seen them at it ! ”
26737	26757	26758	26758	She	907	“ How many times , Kevin ? You do n’t — touch — Daddy ’s — wand — yecchh ! ”
26787	26796	26769	26769	Her	907	“ You bust slug ! You bust slug ! ”
26857	26872	26853	26853	he	1208	“ In broad daylight ! Parents having a lie - in , I suppose — ”
27015	27029	27031	27031	Ron	196	“ Er — is it my eyes , or has everything gone green ? ”
27102	27109	27099	27099	their	1214	“ Harry ! Ron ! Hermione ! ”
27159	27164	27166	27166	Seamus	263	“ Like the decorations ? ”
27170	27178	27166	27166	Seamus	263	“ The Ministry ’s not too happy . ”
27179	27190	27192	27193	Mrs. Finnigan	264	“ Ah , why should n’t we show our colors ? ”
27195	27219	27220	27220	she	264	“ You should see what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents . You ’ll be supporting Ireland , of course ? ”
27255	27267	27252	27252	Ron	196	“ Like we ’d say anything else surrounded by that lot . ”
27268	27282	27284	27284	Hermione	186	“ I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents ? ”
27286	27295	27297	27297	Harry	248	“ Let ’s go and have a look , ”
27382	27385	27387	27387	Ron	196	“ Krum , ”
27390	27393	27395	27395	Hermione	186	“ What ? ”
27397	27400	27402	27402	Ron	196	“ Krum ! ”
27404	27412	27402	27402	Ron	196	“ Viktor Krum , the Bulgarian Seeker ! ”
27413	27419	27421	27421	Hermione	186	“ He looks really grumpy , ”
27435	27441	27442	27442	Ron	196	“ ‘ Really grumpy ’ ? ”
27450	27488	27442	27442	Ron	196	“ Who cares what he looks like ? He ’s unbelievable . He ’s really young too . Only just eighteen or something . He ’s a genius , you wait until tonight , you ’ll see . ”
27566	27598	27551	27551	he	1027	“ Just put them on , Archie , there ’s a good chap . You ca n’t walk around like that , the Muggle at the gate ’s already getting suspicious — ”
27599	27608	27610	27612	the old wizard	1233	“ I bought this in a Muggle shop , ”
27615	27620	27610	27612	the old wizard	1233	“ Muggles wear them . ”
27621	27637	27644	27644	he	1234	“ Muggle women wear them , Archie , not the men , they wear these , ”
27650	27658	27660	27661	old Archie	265	“ I ’m not putting them on , ”
27665	27678	27660	27661	old Archie	265	“ I like a healthy breeze ’ round my privates , thanks . ”
27884	27891	27892	27892	he	248	“ Who d’you reckon they are ? ”
27895	27906	27892	27892	he	248	“ They do n’t go to Hogwarts , do they ? ”
27907	27917	27919	27919	Ron	196	“ ’ Spect they go to some foreign school , ”
27921	27999	27919	27919	Ron	196	“ I know there are others . Never met anyone who went to one , though . Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil … this was years and years ago … and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad could n’t afford it . His penfriend got all offended when he said he was n’t going and sent him a cursed hat . It made his ears shrivel up . ”
28081	28087	28089	28089	George	201	“ You ’ve been ages , ”
28101	28107	28109	28109	Ron	196	“ Met a few people , ”
28116	28125	28109	28109	Ron	196	“ You not got that fire started yet ? ”
28126	28135	28137	28137	Fred	200	“ Dad ’s having fun with the matches , ”
28183	28186	28187	28187	he	198	“ Oops ! ”
28203	28210	28212	28212	Hermione	186	“ Come here , Mr. Weasley , ”
28330	28405	28299	28300	Mr. Weasley	198	“ That was Cuthbert Mockridge , Head of the Goblin Liaison Office . … Here comes Gilbert Wimple ; he ’s with the Committee on Experimental Charms ; he ’s had those horns for a while now . … Hello , Arnie … Arnold Peasegood , he ’s an Obliviator — member of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad , you know . … and that ’s Bode and Croaker … they ’re Unspeakables . … ”
28406	28411	28484	28484	They	1257	“ They ’re what ? ”
28412	28431	28299	28300	Mr. Weasley	198	“ From the Department of Mysteries , top secret , no idea what they get up to . … ”
28465	28471	28473	28473	Percy	214	“ Just Apparated , Dad , ”
28476	28483	28473	28473	Percy	214	“ Ah , excellent , lunch ! ”
28514	28517	28518	28518	he	198	“ Aha ! ”
28521	28530	28518	28518	he	198	“ The man of the moment ! Ludo ! ”
28659	28663	28664	28664	Bagman	230	“ Ahoy there ! ”
28693	28699	28700	28700	he	230	“ Arthur , old man , ”
28708	28749	28700	28700	he	230	“ what a day , eh ? What a day ! Could we have asked for more perfect weather ? A cloudless night coming … and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements . … Not much for me to do ! ”
28818	28823	28825	28826	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Ah — yes , ”
28830	28882	28825	28826	Mr. Weasley	198	“ this is my son Percy . He ’s just started at the Ministry — and this is Fred — no , George , sorry — that ’s Fred — Bill , Charlie , Ron — my daughter , Ginny — and Ron ’s friends , Hermione Granger and Harry Potter . ”
28913	28916	28917	28918	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Everyone , ”
28921	28945	28917	28918	Mr. Weasley	198	“ this is Ludo Bagman , you know who he is , it ’s thanks to him we ’ve got such good tickets — ”
28961	28971	28972	28972	he	230	“ Fancy a flutter on the match , Arthur ? ”
28998	29052	28972	28972	he	230	“ I ’ve already got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will score first — I offered him nice odds , considering Ireland ’s front three are the strongest I ’ve seen in years — and little Agatha Timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a week - long match . ”
29053	29060	29062	29063	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Oh … go on then , ”
29065	29077	29062	29063	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Let ’s see … a Galleon on Ireland to win ? ”
29078	29082	29083	29084	Ludo Bagman	230	“ A Galleon ? ”
29093	29104	29091	29091	himself	230	“ Very well , very well … any other takers ? ”
29105	29115	29117	29118	Mr. Weasley	198	“ They ’re a bit young to be gambling , ”
29120	29126	29117	29118	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Molly would n’t like — ”
29127	29142	29144	29144	Fred	200	“ We ’ll bet thirty - seven Galleons , fifteen Sickles , three Knuts , ”
29155	29177	29144	29144	Fred	200	“ that Ireland wins — but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch . Oh and we ’ll throw in a fake wand . ”
29178	29192	29193	29193	Percy	214	“ You do n’t want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that — ”
29247	29268	29242	29242	Bagman	230	“ Excellent ! I have n’t seen one that convincing in years ! I ’d pay five Galleons for that ! ”
29278	29281	29286	29286	his	198	“ Boys , ”
29289	29308	29286	29286	his	198	“ I do n’t want you betting . … That ’s all your savings . … Your mother — ”
29309	29318	29320	29321	Ludo Bagman	230	“ Do n’t be a spoilsport , Arthur ! ”
29328	29388	29320	29321	Ludo Bagman	230	“ They ’re old enough to know what they want ! You reckon Ireland will win but Krum’ll get the Snitch ? Not a chance , boys , not a chance . … I ’ll give you excellent odds on that one . … We ’ll add five Galleons for the funny wand , then , shall we . … ”
29412	29415	29417	29417	George	201	“ Cheers , ”
29442	29499	29433	29433	Bagman	230	“ Could n’t do me a brew , I suppose ? I ’m keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch . My Bulgarian opposite number ’s making difficulties , and I ca n’t understand a word he ’s saying . Barty’ll be able to sort it out . He speaks about a hundred and fifty languages . ”
29500	29504	29506	29506	Percy	214	“ Mr. Crouch ? ”
29523	29536	29506	29506	Percy	214	“ He speaks over two hundred ! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll … ”
29537	29543	29545	29545	Fred	200	“ Anyone can speak Troll , ”
29548	29559	29545	29545	Fred	200	“ All you have to do is point and grunt . ”
29581	29591	29592	29593	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet , Ludo ? ”
29607	29613	29615	29615	Bagman	230	“ Not a dicky bird , ”
29618	29666	29615	29615	Bagman	230	“ But she ’ll turn up . Poor old Bertha … memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction . Lost , you take my word for it . She ’ll wander back into the office sometime in October , thinking it ’s still July . ”
29667	29684	29685	29686	Mr. Weasley	198	“ You do n’t think it might be time to send someone to look for her ? ”
29696	29703	29705	29705	Bagman	230	“ Barty Crouch keeps saying that , ”
29713	29734	29705	29705	Bagman	230	“ but we really ca n’t spare anyone at the moment . Oh — talk of the devil ! Barty ! ”
29881	29891	29893	29893	Ludo	230	“ Pull up a bit of grass , Barty , ”
29902	29909	29911	29911	Crouch	278	“ No thank you , Ludo , ”
29924	29947	29911	29911	Crouch	278	“ I ’ve been looking for you everywhere . The Bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the Top Box . ”
29948	29957	29959	29959	Bagman	230	“ Oh is that what they ’re after ? ”
29961	29981	29959	29959	Bagman	230	“ I thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers . Bit of a strong accent . ”
29982	29986	29988	29988	Percy	214	“ Mr. Crouch ! ”
30007	30016	29988	29988	Percy	214	“ Would you like a cup of tea ? ”
30017	30020	30022	30023	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Oh , ”
30033	30040	30022	30023	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Yes — thank you , Weatherby ”
30064	30079	30081	30082	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Oh and I ’ve been wanting a word with you too , Arthur , ”
30092	30113	30084	30084	his	248	“ Ali Bashir ’s on the warpath . He wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets . ”
30121	30167	30084	30084	his	248	“ I sent him an owl about that just last week . If I ’ve told him once I ’ve told him a hundred times : Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects , but will he listen ? ”
30168	30173	30175	30176	Mr. Crouch	248	“ I doubt it , ”
30184	30192	30175	30176	Mr. Crouch	248	“ He ’s desperate to export here . ”
30193	30207	30209	30209	Bagman	230	“ Well , they ’ll never replace brooms in Britain , will they ? ”
30211	30226	30228	30229	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Ali thinks there ’s a niche in the market for a family vehicle , ”
30231	30255	30228	30229	Mr. Crouch	248	“ I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve — but that was before carpets were banned , of course . ”
30279	30288	30290	30290	Bagman	230	“ So , been keeping busy , Barty ? ”
30293	30296	30298	30299	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Fairly , ”
30302	30315	30298	30299	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Organizing Portkeys across five continents is no mean feat , Ludo . ”
30316	30329	30331	30332	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I expect you ’ll both be glad when this is over ? ”
30339	30383	30384	30385	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Glad ! Do n’t know when I ’ve had more fun . … Still , it ’s not as though we have n’t got anything to look forward to , eh , Barty ? Eh ? Plenty left to organize , eh ? ”
30392	30405	30387	30387	his	248	“ We agreed not to make the announcement until all the details — ”
30406	30410	30412	30412	Bagman	230	“ Oh details ! ”
30424	30461	30412	30412	Bagman	230	“ They ’ve signed , have n’t they ? They ’ve agreed , have n’t they ? I bet you anything these kids’ll know soon enough anyway . I mean , it ’s happening at Hogwarts — ”
30462	30475	30477	30478	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Ludo , we need to meet the Bulgarians , you know , ”

40870	40879	40881	40881	Ron	196	“ Maybe it ’s back in the tent , ”
40883	40896	40897	40897	Hermione	186	“ Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running ? ”
40901	40904	40906	40906	Harry	162	“ Yeah , ”

41157	41214	41154	41154	Hermione	186	“ It ’s slavery , that ’s what it is ! That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium , and she was terrified , and he ’s got her bewitched so she ca n’t even run when they start trampling tents ! Why does n’t anyone do something about it ? ”
41215	41227	41228	41228	Ron	196	“ Well , the elves are happy , are n’t they ? ”
41231	41264	41228	41228	Ron	196	“ You heard old Winky back at the match … ‘ House - elves is not supposed to have fun ’ … that ’s what she likes , being bossed around . … ”

41279	41296	41275	41275	Hermione	186	“ who prop up rotten and unjust systems , just because they ’re too lazy to — ”
41308	41318	41320	41320	Ron	196	“ Let ’s just keep moving , shall we ? ”
41482	41495	41496	41498	one of them	1229	“ I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year ! ”

41737	41758	41733	41733	Harry	248	“ I reckon we can just wait here , you know . We ’ll hear anyone coming a mile off . ”
41829	41834	41835	41835	he	248	“ Who ’s that ? ”
41850	41861	41835	41835	he	248	“ What are you doing in here , all alone ? ”
41870	41882	41884	41884	Ron	196	“ Well — there ’s a sort of riot going on , ”
41891	41894	41886	41886	Bagman	230	“ What ? ”
41895	41912	41913	41913	Bagman	230	“ At the campsite … some people have got hold of a family of Muggles . … ”
41917	41921	41922	41922	he	230	“ Damn them ! ”
41941	41955	41957	41957	Hermione	186	“ Not exactly on top of things , Mr. Bagman , is he ? ”
41961	41970	41972	41972	Ron	196	“ He was a great Beater , though , ”
42001	42019	41972	41972	Ron	196	“ The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them . ”
42094	42102	42104	42104	Hermione	186	“ I hope the others are okay , ”
42109	42115	42117	42117	Ron	196	“ They ’ll be fine , ”
42119	42128	42130	42130	Harry	248	“ Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy , ”
42150	42164	42143	42143	Krum	234	“ He ’s always said he ’d like to get something on him . ”
42165	42180	42182	42182	Ron	196	“ That ’d wipe the smirk off old Draco ’s face , all right , ”
42184	42191	42193	42193	Hermione	186	“ Those poor Muggles , though , ”
42196	42206	42193	42193	Hermione	186	“ What if they ca n’t get them down ? ”
42207	42211	42213	42213	Ron	196	“ They will , ”
42216	42223	42213	42213	Ron	196	“ They ’ll find a way . ”
42224	42245	42247	42247	Hermione	186	“ Mad , though , to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic ’s out here tonight ! ”
42249	42276	42247	42247	Hermione	186	“ I mean , how do they expect to get away with it ? Do you think they ’ve been drinking , or are they just — ”

44149	44155	44157	44158	Mr. Diggory	247	“ And she had one , ”

44561	44566	44559	44559	Harry	248	“ I dropped it ! ”
44567	44572	44574	44575	Mr. Diggory	247	“ You dropped it ? ”
44579	44595	44574	44575	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Is this a confession ? You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark ? ”
44596	44606	44608	44609	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Amos , think who you ’re talking to ! ”
44614	44625	44608	44609	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Is Harry Potter likely to conjure the Dark Mark ? ”
44626	44633	44635	44636	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Er — of course not , ”
44638	44644	44635	44636	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Sorry … carried away … ”
44645	44655	44657	44657	Harry	162	“ I did n’t drop it there , anyway , ”
44669	44681	44660	44660	his	162	“ I missed it right after we got into the wood . ”
44682	44685	44687	44688	Mr. Diggory	247	“ So , ”
44707	44735	44694	44694	he	247	“ You found this wand , eh , elf ? And you picked it up and thought you ’d have some fun with it , did you ? ”
44736	44747	44749	44749	Winky	286	“ I is not doing magic with it , sir ! ”
44763	44795	44749	44749	Winky	286	“ I is … I is … I is just picking it up , sir ! I is not making the Dark Mark , sir , I is not knowing how ! ”
44796	44802	44806	44806	She	186	“ It was n’t her ! ”
44827	44848	44849	44849	She	186	“ Winky ’s got a squeaky little voice , and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper ! ”
44862	44874	44849	44849	She	186	“ It did n’t sound anything like Winky , did it ? ”
44875	44878	44880	44880	Harry	162	“ No , ”
44886	44896	44880	44880	Harry	162	“ It definitely did n’t sound like an elf . ”
44897	44906	44908	44908	Ron	196	“ Yeah , it was a human voice , ”
44910	44918	44920	44921	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Well , we ’ll soon see , ”
44926	44948	44920	44921	Mr. Diggory	247	“ There ’s a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed , elf , did you know that ? ”
44979	44983	44985	44986	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Prior Incantato ! ”
45044	45047	45048	45049	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Deletrius ! ”
45063	45066	45068	45069	Mr. Diggory	247	“ So , ”
45088	45095	45096	45096	she	286	“ I is not doing it ! ”
45105	45138	45096	45096	she	286	“ I is not , I is not , I is not knowing how ! I is a good elf , I is n’t using wands , I is n’t knowing how ! ”
45139	45150	45151	45152	Mr. Diggory	247	“ You ’ve been caught red - handed , elf ! ”
45155	45165	45151	45152	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Caught with the guilty wand in your hand ! ”
45166	45169	45171	45172	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Amos , ”
45175	45198	45171	45172	Mr. Weasley	198	“ think about it … precious few wizards know how to do that spell . … Where would she have learned it ? ”
45199	45205	45207	45208	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Perhaps Amos is suggesting , ”
45216	45229	45207	45208	Mr. Crouch	248	“ that I routinely teach my servants to conjure the Dark Mark ? ”
45242	45252	45237	45238	Amos Diggory	239	“ Mr. Crouch … not … not at all … ”
45253	45277	45279	45280	Mr. Crouch	248	“ You have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that Mark ! ”
45282	45302	45279	45280	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Harry Potter — and myself ! I suppose you are familiar with the boy ’s story , Amos ? ”
45303	45310	45312	45313	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Of course — everyone knows — ”
45319	45351	45352	45353	Mr. Crouch	248	“ And I trust you remember the many proofs I have given , over a long career , that I despise and detest the Dark Arts and those who practice them ? ”
45361	45378	45379	45380	Amos Diggory	239	“ Mr. Crouch , I — I never suggested you had anything to do with it ! ”
45392	45405	45407	45408	Mr. Crouch	248	“ If you accuse my elf , you accuse me , Diggory ! ”
45410	45421	45407	45408	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Where else would she have learned to conjure it ? ”
45422	45433	45387	45387	his	239	“ She — she might ’ve picked it up anywhere — ”
45434	45439	45441	45442	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Precisely , Amos , ”
45444	45456	45457	45457	he	198	“ She might have picked it up anywhere . … Winky ? ”
45478	45488	45471	45471	he	198	“ Where exactly did you find Harry ’s wand ? ”
45508	45523	45524	45524	she	286	“ I — I is finding it … finding it there , sir . … ”
45527	45537	45524	45524	she	286	“ there … in the trees , sir . … ”
45538	45544	45546	45547	Mr. Weasley	198	“ You see , Amos ? ”
45549	45605	45546	45547	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Whoever conjured the Mark could have Disapparated right after they ’d done it , leaving Harry ’s wand behind . A clever thing to do , not using their own wand , which could have betrayed them . And Winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up .
45606	45624	45626	45627	Mr. Diggory	247	“ But then , she ’d have been only a few feet away from the real culprit ! ”
45630	45638	45626	45627	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Elf ? Did you see anyone ? ”
45670	45682	45665	45665	she	286	“ I is seeing no one , sir … no one … ”
45683	45686	45688	45689	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Amos , ”
45692	45732	45688	45689	Mr. Crouch	248	“ I am fully aware that , in the ordinary course of events , you would want to take Winky into your department for questioning . I ask you , however , to allow me to deal with her . ”
45774	45785	45786	45787	Mr. Crouch	248	“ You may rest assured that she will be punished , ”
45791	45798	45799	45799	Winky	286	“ M - m - master … ”
45814	45827	45808	45808	her	286	“ M - m - master , p - p - please … ”
45854	45869	45870	45870	he	248	“ Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible , ”
45874	45911	45870	45870	he	248	“ I told her to remain in the tent . I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble . And I find that she disobeyed me . This means clothes . ”
45912	45915	45917	45917	Winky	286	“ No ! ”
45927	45938	45917	45917	Winky	286	“ No , master ! Not clothes , not clothes ! ”
45982	45988	45989	45989	Hermione	186	“ But she was frightened ! ”
45999	46030	45996	45997	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Your elf ’s scared of heights , and those wizards in masks were levitating people ! You ca n’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way ! ”
46067	46081	46082	46082	he	248	“ I have no use for a house - elf who disobeys me , ”
46091	46115	46082	46082	he	248	“ I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master , and to her master ’s reputation . ”
46147	46189	46140	46141	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Well , I think I ’ll take my lot back to the tent , if nobody ’s got any objections . Amos , that wand ’s told us all it can — if Harry could have it back , please — ”
46201	46208	46209	46210	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Come on , you three , ”
46233	46236	46224	46224	her	186	“ Hermione ! ”
46261	46270	46272	46272	Hermione	186	“ What ’s going to happen to Winky ? ”
46282	46288	46290	46291	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I do n’t know , ”
46293	46301	46303	46303	Hermione	186	“ The way they were treating her ! ”
46306	46364	46303	46303	Hermione	186	“ Mr. Diggory , calling her ‘ elf ’ all the time … and Mr. Crouch ! He knows she did n’t do it and he ’s still going to sack her ! He did n’t care how frightened she ’d been , or how upset she was — it was like she was n’t even human ! ”
46365	46372	46374	46374	Ron	196	“ Well , she ’s not , ”
46381	46400	46303	46303	Hermione	186	“ That does n’t mean she has n’t got feelings , Ron . It ’s disgusting the way — ”
46401	46409	46411	46412	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Hermione , I agree with you , ”
46419	46451	46416	46416	her	186	“ but now is not the time to discuss elf rights . I want to get back to the tent as fast as we can . What happened to the others ? ”
46452	46460	46462	46462	Ron	196	“ We lost them in the dark , ”
46464	46477	46462	46462	Ron	196	“ Dad , why was everyone so uptight about that skull thing ? ”
46478	46488	46490	46491	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I ’ll explain everything back at the tent , ”
46539	46547	46533	46535	many of them	1664	“ What ’s going on in there ? ”
46548	46553	46527	46528	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Who conjured it ? ”
46554	46563	46533	46535	many of them	1664	“ Arthur — it ’s not — Him ? ”
46564	46572	46574	46575	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Of course it ’s not Him , ”
46578	46606	46574	46575	Mr. Weasley	198	“ We do n’t know who it was ; it looks like they Disapparated . Now excuse me , please , I want to get to bed . ”
46658	46666	46667	46667	he	198	“ Dad , what ’s going on ? ”
46673	46688	46667	46667	he	198	“ Fred , George , and Ginny got back okay , but the others — ”
46689	46696	46698	46699	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I ’ve got them here , ”
46768	46776	46778	46778	Bill	219	“ Did you get them , Dad ? ”
46781	46789	46778	46778	Bill	219	“ The person who conjured the Mark ? ”
46790	46793	46795	46796	Mr. Weasley	198	“ No , ”
46798	46823	46795	46796	Mr. Weasley	198	“ We found Barty Crouch ’s elf holding Harry ’s wand , but we ’re none the wiser about who actually conjured the Mark . ”
46824	46827	46829	46829	Bill	219	“ What ? ”
46837	46842	46844	46844	Fred	200	“ Harry ’s wand ? ”
46846	46852	46854	46854	Percy	282	“ Mr. Crouch ’s elf ? ”
46891	46908	46909	46909	he	282	“ Well , Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that ! ”
46912	46956	46909	46909	he	282	“ Running away when he ’d expressly told her not to … embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry … how would that have looked , if she ’d been brought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control — ”
46957	46976	46977	46977	Hermione	186	“ She did n’t do anything — she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time ! ”
47008	47035	47037	47037	Percy	282	“ Hermione , a wizard in Mr. Crouch ’s position ca n’t afford a house - elf who ’s going to run amok with a wand ! ”
47043	47050	47052	47052	Hermione	186	“ She did n’t run amok ! ”
47054	47064	47052	47052	Hermione	186	“ She just picked it up off the ground ! ”
47065	47078	47080	47080	Ron	196	“ Look , can someone just explain what that skull thing was ? ”
47083	47099	47080	47080	Ron	196	“ It was n’t hurting anyone . … Why ’s it such a big deal ? ”
47100	47117	47119	47119	Hermione	186	“ I told you , it ’s You - Know - Who ’s symbol , Ron , ”
47127	47142	47119	47119	Hermione	186	“ I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts . ”
47143	47154	47156	47157	Mr. Weasley	198	“ And it has n’t been seen for thirteen years , ”
47160	47179	47156	47157	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Of course people panicked … it was almost like seeing You - Know - Who back again . ”
47180	47187	47189	47189	Ron	196	“ I do n’t get it , ”
47193	47208	47189	47189	Ron	196	“ I mean … it ’s still only a shape in the sky . … ”
47209	47231	47233	47234	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Ron , You - Know - Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed , ”
47236	47277	47233	47234	Mr. Weasley	198	“ The terror it inspired … you have no idea , you ’re too young . Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house , and knowing what you ’re about to find inside . … ”
47282	47292	47278	47279	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Everyone ’s worst fear … the very worst … ”
47317	47379	47301	47301	Bill	219	“ Well , it did n’t help us tonight , whoever conjured it . It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it . They all Disapparated before we ’d got near enough to unmask any of them . We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground , though . They ’re having their memories modified right now . ”
47380	47384	47386	47386	Harry	248	“ Death Eaters ? ”
47388	47394	47386	47386	Harry	248	“ What are Death Eaters ? ”
47395	47409	47411	47411	Bill	219	“ It ’s what You - Know - Who ’s supporters called themselves , ”
47413	47438	47411	47411	Bill	219	“ I think we saw what ’s left of them tonight — the ones who managed to keep themselves out of Azkaban , anyway . ”
47439	47450	47452	47453	Mr. Weasley	198	“ We ca n’t prove it was them , Bill , ”
47455	47461	47462	47462	he	198	“ Though it probably was , ”
47466	47474	47476	47476	Ron	196	“ Yeah , I bet it was ! ”
47479	47523	47476	47476	Ron	196	“ Dad , we met Draco Malfoy in the woods , and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks ! And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You - Know - Who ! ”
47524	47532	47533	47533	Harry	248	“ But what were Voldemort ’s supporters — ”
47555	47558	47560	47560	Harry	248	“ Sorry , ”
47563	47587	47560	47560	Harry	248	“ What were You - Know - Who ’s supporters up to , levitating Muggles ? I mean , what was the point ? ”
47588	47592	47594	47595	Mr. Weasley	198	“ The point ? ”
47601	47661	47662	47662	he	248	“ Harry , that ’s their idea of fun . Half the Muggle killings back when You - Know - Who was in power were done for fun . I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and could n’t resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large . A nice little reunion for them , ”
47666	47686	47688	47688	Ron	196	“ But if they were the Death Eaters , why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark ? ”
47690	47704	47688	47688	Ron	196	“ They ’d have been pleased to see it , would n’t they ? ”
47705	47712	47714	47714	Bill	219	“ Use your brains , Ron , ”
47716	47817	47714	47714	Bill	219	“ If they really were Death Eaters , they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You - Know - Who lost power , and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people . I bet they ’d be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back . They denied they ’d ever been involved with him when he lost his powers , and went back to their daily lives . … I do n’t reckon he ’d be over - pleased with them , do you ? ”
47818	47827	47829	47829	Hermione	186	“ So … whoever conjured the Dark Mark … ”
47832	47851	47829	47829	Hermione	186	“ were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters , or to scare them away ? ”
47852	47863	47865	47866	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Your guess is as good as ours , Hermione , ”
47868	47958	47865	47866	Mr. Weasley	198	“ But I ’ll tell you this … it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it . I ’d be very surprised if the person who did it had n’t been a Death Eater once , even if they ’re not now . … Listen , it ’s very late , and if your mother hears what ’s happened she ’ll be worried sick . We ’ll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early Portkey out of here . ”
48186	48190	48179	48179	he	250	“ Merry Christmas . ”
48191	48198	48200	48201	Mr. Weasley	198	“ He ’ll be all right , ”
48211	48245	48200	48201	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Sometimes , when a person ’s memory ’s modified , it makes him a bit disorientated for a while … and that was a big thing they had to make him forget . ”
48387	48395	48455	48455	She	199	“ Oh thank goodness , thank goodness ! ”
48442	48454	48422	48422	her	199	“ Arthur — I ’ve been so worried — so worried — ”
48514	48520	48521	48522	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ You ’re all right , ”
48539	48548	48521	48522	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ you ’re alive . … Oh boys … ”
48575	48585	48555	48555	she	199	“ Ouch ! Mum — you ’re strangling us — ”
48586	48595	48596	48597	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ I shouted at you before you left ! ”
48604	48648	48596	48597	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ It ’s all I ’ve been thinking about ! What if You - Know - Who had got you , and the last thing I ever said to you was that you did n’t get enough O.W.L.s ? Oh Fred … George … ”
48649	48663	48665	48666	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Come on , now , Molly , we ’re all perfectly okay , ”
48682	48685	48686	48686	he	198	“ Bill , ”
48692	48707	48686	48686	he	198	“ pick up that paper , I want to see what it says . … ”
48765	48770	48772	48773	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I knew it , ”
48776	48807	48772	48773	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Ministry blunders … culprits not apprehended … lax security … Dark wizards running unchecked … national disgrace … Who wrote this ? Ah … of course … Rita Skeeter . ”
48808	48821	48823	48823	Percy	282	“ That woman ’s got it in for the Ministry of Magic ! ”
48826	48874	48823	48823	Percy	282	“ Last week she was saying we ’re wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness , when we should be stamping out vampires ! As if it was n’t specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non - Wizard Part - Humans — ”
48875	48883	48885	48885	Bill	219	“ Do us a favor , Perce , ”
48889	48894	48885	48885	Bill	219	“ and shut up . ”
48895	48900	48902	48903	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I ’m mentioned , ”
48922	48925	48927	48928	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Where ? ”
48937	48952	48932	48932	her	199	“ If I ’d seen that , I ’d have known you were alive ! ”
48953	48958	48960	48961	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Not by name , ”
48963	49058	49060	49061	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Listen to this : ‘ If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry of Magic , they were sadly disappointed . A Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that nobody had been hurt , but refusing to give any more information . Whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later , remains to be seen . ’ Oh really , ”
49071	49106	49069	49069	Percy	282	“ Nobody was hurt . What was I supposed to say ? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods … well , there certainly will be rumors now she ’s printed that . ”
49113	49136	49107	49107	He	198	“ Molly , I ’m going to have to go into the office ; this is going to take some smoothing over . ”
49137	49146	49148	49148	Percy	282	“ I ’ll come with you , Father , ”
49151	49172	49148	49148	Percy	282	“ Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck . And I can give him my cauldron report in person . ”
49186	49216	49180	49181	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Arthur , you ’re supposed to be on holiday ! This has n’t got anything to do with your office ; surely they can handle this without you ? ”
49217	49226	49228	49229	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I ’ve got to go , Molly , ”
49231	49252	49228	49229	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I ’ve made things worse . I ’ll just change into my robes and I ’ll be off . … ”
49253	49257	49259	49259	Harry	248	“ Mrs. Weasley , ”
49267	49281	49259	49259	Harry	248	“ Hedwig has n’t arrived with a letter for me , has she ? ”
49282	49287	49289	49290	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Hedwig , dear ? ”
49293	49307	49289	49290	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ No … no , there has n’t been any post at all . ”
49327	49343	49324	49324	he	248	“ All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room , Ron ? ”
49344	49352	49354	49354	Ron	196	“ Yeah … think I will too , ”
49358	49361	49354	49354	Ron	196	“ Hermione ? ”
49362	49365	49366	49366	she	186	“ Yes , ”
49385	49392	49394	49394	Ron	196	“ What ’s up , Harry ? ”
49410	49420	49421	49421	Harry	248	“ There ’s something I have n’t told you , ”
49424	49438	49421	49421	Harry	248	“ On Saturday morning , I woke up with my scar hurting again . ”
49495	49531	49490	49490	Ron	196	“ But — he was n’t there , was he ? You - Know - Who ? I mean — last time your scar kept hurting , he was at Hogwarts , was n’t he ? ”
49532	49543	49545	49545	Harry	248	“ I ’m sure he was n’t on Privet Drive , ”
49547	49582	49545	49545	Harry	248	“ But I was dreaming about him … him and Peter — you know , Wormtail . I ca n’t remember all of it now , but they were plotting to kill … someone . ”
49594	49597	49583	49583	He	248	“ me , ”
49615	49622	49624	49624	Ron	196	“ It was only a dream , ”
49627	49632	49624	49624	Ron	196	“ Just a nightmare . ”
49633	49642	49644	49644	Harry	248	“ Yeah , but was it , though ? ”
49658	49695	49644	49644	Harry	248	“ It ’s weird , is n’t it ? … My scar hurts , and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march , and Voldemort ’s sign ’s up in the sky again . ”
49696	49706	49707	49707	Ron	196	“ Do n’t — say — his — name ! ”
49713	49721	49722	49722	Harry	248	“ And remember what Professor Trelawney said ? ”
49729	49737	49722	49722	Harry	248	“ At the end of last year ? ”
49760	49778	49753	49753	she	186	“ Oh Harry , you are n’t going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says ? ”
49779	49785	49787	49787	Harry	248	“ You were n’t there , ”
49789	49855	49787	49787	Harry	248	“ You did n’t hear her . This time was different . I told you , she went into a trance — a real one . And she said the Dark Lord would rise again … greater and more terrible than ever before … and he ’d manage it because his servant was going to go back to him … and that night Wormtail escaped . ”
49874	49886	49887	49887	Hermione	186	“ Why were you asking if Hedwig had come , Harry ? ”
49890	49897	49887	49887	Hermione	186	“ Are you expecting a letter ? ”
49898	49906	49908	49908	Harry	248	“ I told Sirius about my scar , ”
49912	49920	49908	49908	Harry	248	“ I ’m waiting for his answer . ”
49921	49925	49927	49927	Ron	196	“ Good thinking ! ”
49933	49942	49927	49927	Ron	196	“ I bet Sirius’ll know what to do ! ”
49943	49954	49956	49956	Harry	248	“ I hoped he ’d get back to me quickly , ”
49958	49980	49982	49982	Hermione	186	“ But we do n’t know where Sirius is … he could be in Africa or somewhere , could n’t he ? ”
49985	49999	49982	49982	Hermione	186	“ Hedwig ’s not going to manage that journey in a few days . ”
50000	50006	50008	50008	Harry	248	“ Yeah , I know , ”
50033	50047	50049	50049	Ron	196	“ Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard , Harry , ”
50051	50079	50049	50049	Ron	196	“ Come on — three on three , Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play . … You can try out the Wronski Feint . … ”
50080	50083	50085	50085	Hermione	186	“ Ron , ”
50106	50137	50085	50085	Hermione	186	“ Harry does n’t want to play Quidditch right now . … He ’s worried , and he ’s tired . … We all need to go to bed . … ”
50138	50147	50149	50149	Harry	248	“ Yeah , I want to play Quidditch , ”
50152	50162	50149	50149	Harry	248	“ Hang on , I ’ll get my Firebolt . ”
50175	50178	50163	50163	Hermione	186	“ Boys . ”
50219	50227	50228	50228	Percy	282	“ It ’s been an absolute uproar , ”
50244	50290	50228	50228	Percy	282	“ I ’ve been putting out fires all week . People keep sending Howlers , and of course , if you do n’t open a Howler straight away , it explodes . Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders . ”
50291	50299	50301	50301	Ginny	222	“ Why are they all sending Howlers ? ”
50328	50337	50339	50339	Percy	282	“ Complaining about security at the World Cup , ”
50341	50391	50339	50339	Percy	282	“ They want compensation for their ruined property . Mundungus Fletcher ’s put in a claim for a twelve - bedroomed tent with en - suite Jacuzzi , but I ’ve got his number . I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks . ”
50464	50467	50535	50536	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Home , ”

50583	50607	50580	50580	she	199	“ They ’re working him far too hard . His dinner ’s going to be ruined if he does n’t come home soon . ”
50608	50630	50632	50632	Percy	282	“ Well , Father feels he ’s got to make up for his mistake at the match , does n’t he ? ”
50634	50660	50632	50632	Percy	282	“ If truth be told , he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his Head of Department first — ”
50661	50677	50679	50680	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Do n’t you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter woman wrote ! ”
50687	50712	50714	50714	Bill	219	“ If Dad had n’t said anything , old Rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented , ”
50723	50755	50714	50714	Bill	219	“ Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good . Remember , she interviewed all the Gringotts ’ Charm Breakers once , and called me ‘ a long - haired pillock ’ ? ”
50756	50767	50769	50770	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Well , it is a bit long , dear , ”
50773	50781	50769	50770	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ If you ’d just let me — ”

50928	50939	50941	50941	George	201	“ Yeah , we ’ve left it a bit late , ”
50943	50960	50962	50963	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ You ’re not by any chance writing out a new order form , are you ? ”
50966	50983	50962	50963	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ You would n’t be thinking of restarting Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes , by any chance ? ”
50984	50989	50991	50991	Fred	200	“ Now , Mum , ”
51005	51039	51002	51002	his	1726	“ If the Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow , and George and I died , how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusation ? ”

51185	51244	51162	51162	he	198	“ Rita Skeeter ’s been ferreting around all week , looking for more Ministry mess - ups to report . And now she ’s found out about poor old Bertha going missing , so that ’ll be the headline in the Prophet tomorrow . I told Bagman he should have sent someone to look for her ages ago . ”
51245	51257	51259	51259	Percy	282	“ Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks , ”
51262	51275	51277	51278	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Crouch is very lucky Rita has n’t found out about Winky , ”
51281	51307	51277	51278	Mr. Weasley	198	“ There ’d be a week ’s worth of headlines in his house - elf being caught holding the wand that conjured the Dark Mark . ”
51308	51328	51330	51330	Percy	282	“ I thought we were all agreed that that elf , while irresponsible , did not conjure the Mark ? ”
51333	51358	51360	51360	Hermione	186	“ If you ask me , Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily Prophet knows how mean he is to elves ! ”
51363	51370	51372	51372	Percy	282	“ Now look here , Hermione ! ”
51374	51391	51372	51372	Percy	282	“ A high - ranking Ministry official like Mr. Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants — ”
51392	51399	51401	51401	Hermione	186	“ His slave , you mean ! ”
51408	51419	51403	51403	her	186	“ because he did n’t pay Winky , did he ? ”
51420	51437	51439	51440	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ I think you ’d all better go upstairs and check that you ’ve packed properly ! ”
51447	51457	51439	51440	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Come on now , all of you . … ”
51546	51553	51555	51555	Ron	196	“ Bung him some Owl Treats , ”
51564	51571	51555	51555	Ron	196	“ It might shut him up . ”
51603	51611	51612	51612	Harry	248	“ It ’s been over a week , ”
51622	51637	51612	51612	Harry	248	“ Ron , you do n’t reckon Sirius has been caught , do you ? ”
51638	51650	51652	51652	Ron	196	“ Nah , it would ’ve been in the Daily Prophet , ”
51654	51670	51652	51652	Ron	196	“ The Ministry would want to show they ’d caught someone , would n’t they ? ”
51671	51678	51612	51612	Harry	248	“ Yeah , I suppose . … ”
51679	51715	51716	51716	He	196	“ Look , here ’s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley . And she ’s got some gold out of your vault for you … and she ’s washed all your socks . ”
51818	51826	51808	51808	Ron	196	“ What is that supposed to be ? ”
51882	51887	51888	51888	she	199	“ Here you are , ”
51897	51911	51888	51888	she	199	“ Now , mind you pack them properly so they do n’t crease . ”
51912	51924	51926	51926	Ron	196	“ Mum , you ’ve given me Ginny ’s new dress , ”
51934	51941	51943	51944	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Of course I have n’t , ”
51946	51955	51943	51944	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ That ’s for you . Dress robes . ”
51956	51959	51961	51961	Ron	196	“ What ? ”
51968	51972	51974	51975	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Dress robes ! ”
51977	52000	51974	51975	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ It says on your school list that you ’re supposed to have dress robes this year … robes for formal occasions . ”
52001	52009	52011	52011	Ron	196	“ You ’ve got to be kidding , ”
52015	52025	52011	52011	Ron	196	“ I ’m not wearing that , no way . ”
52026	52033	52035	52036	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Everyone wears them , Ron ! ”
52039	52055	52035	52036	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ They ’re all like that ! Your father ’s got some for smart parties ! ”
52056	52067	52069	52069	Ron	196	“ I ’ll go starkers before I put that on , ”
52072	52079	52081	52082	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Do n’t be so silly , ”
52084	52112	52081	52082	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ You ’ve got to have dress robes , they ’re on your list ! I got some for Harry too … show him , Harry . … ”
52177	52192	52194	52195	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ I thought they ’d bring out the color of your eyes , dear , ”
52198	52205	52207	52207	Ron	196	“ Well , they ’re okay ! ”
52216	52226	52207	52207	Ron	196	“ Why could n’t I have some like that ? ”
52227	52248	52250	52251	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Because … well , I had to get yours secondhand , and there was n’t a lot of choice ! ”
52284	52291	52292	52292	Ron	196	“ I ’m never wearing them , ”
52297	52300	52292	52292	Ron	196	“ Never . ”
52301	52304	52306	52307	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Fine , ”
52309	52335	52306	52307	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Go naked . And , Harry , make sure you get a picture of him . Goodness knows I could do with a laugh . ”
52366	52374	52376	52376	Ron	196	“ Why is everything I own rubbish ? ”
52483	52486	52487	52487	she	199	“ Arthur ! ”
52493	52502	52487	52487	she	199	“ Arthur ! Urgent message from the Ministry ! ”
52549	52558	52541	52542	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ I ’ve got a quill here somewhere ! ”
52629	52664	52608	52608	It	239	“ … Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting , so they went and called those what - d’you - call-’ems — please - men . Arthur , you ’ve got to get over there — ”
52665	52668	52670	52671	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Here ! ”
52695	52709	52711	52712	Mr. Diggory	247	“ — it ’s a real stroke of luck I heard about it , ”
52716	52756	52711	52712	Mr. Diggory	247	“ I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls , and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off — if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one , Arthur — ”
52757	52766	52768	52769	Mr. Weasley	198	“ What does Mad - Eye say happened ? ”
52795	52820	52787	52788	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Says he heard an intruder in his yard . Says he was creeping toward the house , but was ambushed by his dustbins . ”
52821	52828	52830	52831	Mr. Weasley	198	“ What did the dustbins do ? ”
52836	52855	52857	52858	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere , as far as I can tell , ”
52860	52877	52857	52858	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the please - men turned up — ”
52882	52889	52787	52788	Mr. Diggory	247	“ And what about the intruder ? ”
52890	52899	52901	52902	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Arthur , you know Mad - Eye , ”
52911	52991	52901	52902	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night ? More likely there ’s a very shell - shocked cat wandering around somewhere , covered in potato peelings . But if the Improper Use of Magic lot get their hands on Mad - Eye , he ’s had it — think of his record — we ’ve got to get him off on a minor charge , something in your department — what are exploding dustbins worth ? ”
52992	52998	53000	53001	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Might be a caution , ”
53012	53029	53008	53008	his	198	“ Mad - Eye did n’t use his wand ? He did n’t actually attack anyone ? ”
53030	53050	53052	53053	Mr. Diggory	247	“ I ’ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window , ”
53055	53071	53052	53053	Mr. Diggory	247	“ but they ’ll have a job proving it , there are n’t any casualties . ”
53072	53080	53081	53082	Mr. Weasley	198	“ All right , I ’m off , ”
53116	53123	53081	53082	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Sorry about this , Molly , ”
53130	53174	53081	53082	Mr. Weasley	198	“ bothering you so early and everything … but Arthur ’s the only one who can get Mad - Eye off , and Mad - Eye ’s supposed to be starting his new job today . Why he had to choose last night … ”
53175	53181	53183	53184	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Never mind , Amos , ”
53186	53202	53183	53184	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Sure you wo n’t have a bit of toast or anything before you go ? ”
53203	53210	53212	53213	Mr. Diggory	247	“ Oh go on , then , ”
53247	53250	53251	53251	he	198	“ Fanks , ”
53315	53329	53331	53332	Mr. Weasley	198	“ I ’d better hurry — you have a good term , boys , ”
53353	53371	53331	53332	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Molly , are you going to be all right taking the kids to King ’s Cross ? ”
53372	53378	53379	53379	she	1749	“ Of course I will , ”
53382	53396	53379	53379	she	1749	“ You just look after Mad - Eye , we ’ll be fine . ”
53409	53417	53418	53418	Bill	219	“ Did someone say Mad - Eye ? ”
53421	53429	53418	53418	Bill	219	“ What ’s he been up to now ?
53430	53443	53445	53446	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ He says someone tried to break into his house last night , ”
53448	53454	53456	53456	George	201	“ Mad - Eye Moody ? ”
53465	53472	53456	53456	George	201	“ Is n’t he that nutter — ”
53473	53485	53487	53488	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Your father thinks very highly of Mad - Eye Moody , ”
53491	53504	53506	53506	Fred	200	“ Yeah , well , Dad collects plugs , does n’t he ? ”
53515	53521	53509	53510	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Birds of a feather … ”
53522	53532	53534	53534	Bill	219	“ Moody was a great wizard in his time , ”
53536	53550	53552	53552	Charlie	220	“ He ’s an old friend of Dumbledore ’s , is n’t he ? ”
53554	53569	53571	53571	Fred	200	“ Dumbledore ’s not what you ’d call normal , though , is he ? ”
53573	53586	53571	53571	Fred	200	“ I mean , I know he ’s a genius and everything … ”
53587	53594	53596	53596	Harry	248	“ Who is Mad - Eye ? ”
53598	53610	53612	53612	Charlie	220	“ He ’s retired , used to work at the Ministry , ”
53614	53643	53644	53644	he	220	“ I met him once when Dad took me into work with him . He was an Auror — one of the best … a Dark wizard catcher , ”
53653	53708	53644	53644	he	220	“ Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him . He made himself loads of enemies , though … the families of people he caught , mainly … and I heard he ’s been getting really paranoid in his old age . Does n’t trust anyone anymore . Sees Dark wizards everywhere . ”
53742	53756	53757	53757	he	282	“ I just ca n’t justify taking more time off at the moment , ”
53761	53772	53757	53757	he	282	“ Mr. Crouch is really starting to rely on me . ”
53773	53782	53784	53784	George	201	“ Yeah , you know what , Percy ? ”
53787	53797	53784	53784	George	201	“ I reckon he ’ll know your name soon . ”
53821	53831	53832	53833	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us , ”
53860	53882	53832	53833	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ But there were n’t any to spare . … Oh dear , they do n’t look happy , do they ? ”
54271	54283	54285	54285	Charlie	220	“ I might be seeing you all sooner than you think , ”
54297	54300	54302	54302	Fred	200	“ Why ? ”
54305	54310	54312	54312	Charlie	220	“ You ’ll see , ”
54314	54346	54312	54312	Charlie	220	“ Just do n’t tell Percy I mentioned it … it ’s ‘ classified information , until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it , ’ after all . ”
54347	54362	54364	54364	Bill	219	“ Yeah , I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year , ”
54378	54381	54383	54383	George	201	“ Why ? ”
54386	54396	54398	54398	Bill	219	“ You ’re going to have an interesting year , ”
54404	54421	54400	54400	his	219	“ I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it . … ”
54422	54428	54430	54430	Ron	196	“ A bit of what ? ”
54451	54462	54464	54464	Hermione	186	“ Thanks for having us to stay , Mrs. Weasley , ”
54486	54496	54498	54498	Harry	248	“ Yeah , thanks for everything , Mrs. Weasley , ”
54500	54509	54511	54512	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Oh it was my pleasure , dears , ”
54514	54547	54511	54512	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ I ’d invite you for Christmas , but … well , I expect you ’re all going to want to stay at Hogwarts , what with … one thing and another . ”
54548	54551	54553	54553	Ron	196	“ Mum ! ”
54556	54566	54553	54553	Ron	196	“ What d’you three know that we do n’t ? ”
54567	54578	54580	54581	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ You ’ll find out this evening , I expect , ”
54585	54607	54580	54581	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ It ’s going to be very exciting — mind you , I ’m very glad they ’ve changed the rules — ”
54608	54612	54614	54614	Harry	248	“ What rules ? ”
54624	54654	54580	54581	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ I ’m sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you . … Now , behave , wo n’t you ? Wo n’t you , Fred ? And you , George ? ”
54666	54675	54676	54676	Fred	200	“ Tell us what ’s happening at Hogwarts ! ”
54695	54702	54689	54689	Charlie	220	“ What rules are they changing ? ”
54780	54792	54793	54793	he	196	“ Bagman wanted to tell us what ’s happening at Hogwarts , ”
54803	54822	54793	54793	he	196	“ At the World Cup , remember ? But my own mother wo n’t say . Wonder what — ”
54823	54826	54827	54827	Hermione	186	“ Shh ! ”
54864	54963	54964	54964	Hermione	186	“ … Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts , you know . He knows the headmaster , you see . Well , you know his opinion of Dumbledore — the man ’s such a Mudblood - lover — and Durmstrang does n’t admit that sort of riffraff . But Mother did n’t like the idea of me going to school so far away . Father says Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than Hogwarts about the Dark Arts . Durmstrang students actually learn them , not just the defense rubbish we do . … ”
54985	54998	54999	54999	she	186	“ So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him , does he ? ”
55003	55021	54999	54999	she	186	“ I wish he had gone , then we would n’t have to put up with him . ”
55022	55029	55031	55031	Harry	248	“ Durmstrang ’s another wizarding school ? ”
55033	55036	55038	55038	Hermione	186	“ Yes , ”
55041	55071	55038	55038	Hermione	186	“ and it ’s got a horrible reputation . According to An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe , it puts a lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts . ”
55072	55081	55083	55083	Ron	196	“ I think I ’ve heard of it , ”
55086	55094	55083	55083	Ron	196	“ Where is it ? What country ? ”
55095	55104	55109	55109	her	186	“ Well , nobody knows , do they ? ”
55112	55118	55120	55120	Harry	248	“ Er — why not ? ”
55122	55152	55154	55154	Hermione	186	“ There ’s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools . Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets , ”
55161	55166	55168	55168	Ron	196	“ Come off it , ”
55174	55198	55168	55168	Ron	196	“ Durmstrang ’s got to be about the same size as Hogwarts — how are you going to hide a great big castle ? ”
55199	55205	55207	55207	Hermione	186	“ But Hogwarts is hidden , ”
55212	55230	55207	55207	Hermione	186	“ Everyone knows that … well , everyone who ’s read Hogwarts , A History , anyway . ”
55231	55237	55239	55239	Ron	196	“ Just you , then , ”
55241	55254	55239	55239	Ron	196	“ So go on — how d’you hide a place like Hogwarts ? ”
55255	55260	55262	55262	Hermione	186	“ It ’s bewitched , ”
55264	55295	55262	55262	Hermione	186	“ If a Muggle looks at it , all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER , DO NOT ENTER , UNSAFE . ”
55296	55309	55239	55239	Ron	196	“ So Durmstrang’ll just look like a ruin to an outsider too ? ”
55310	55313	55315	55315	Hermione	186	“ Maybe , ”
55319	55353	55315	55315	Hermione	186	“ or it might have Muggle - repelling charms on it , like the World Cup stadium . And to keep foreign wizards from finding it , they ’ll have made it Unplottable — ”
55354	55358	55239	55239	Ron	196	“ Come again ? ”
55359	55381	55315	55315	Hermione	186	“ Well , you can enchant a building so it ’s impossible to plot on a map , ca n’t you ? ”
55382	55390	55392	55392	Harry	248	“ Er … if you say so , ”
55394	55407	55409	55409	Hermione	186	“ But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north , ”
55412	55429	55409	55409	Hermione	186	“ Somewhere very cold , because they ’ve got fur capes as part of their uniforms . ”
55430	55438	55440	55440	Ron	196	“ Ah , think of the possibilities , ”
55443	55472	55440	55440	Ron	196	“ It would ’ve been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident . … Shame his mother likes him . … ”
55595	55602	55621	55621	Hermione	186	“ Troy — Mullet — Moran ! ”
55669	55677	55678	55678	he	349	“ Gran did n’t want to go , ”
55682	55693	55678	55678	he	349	“ Would n’t buy tickets . It sounded amazing though . ”
55694	55698	55700	55700	Ron	196	“ It was , ”
55702	55710	55700	55700	Ron	196	“ Look at this , Neville . … ”
55731	55735	55737	55737	Neville	349	“ Oh wow , ”
55748	55759	55761	55761	Ron	196	“ We saw him right up close , as well , ”
55763	55771	55761	55761	Ron	196	“ We were in the Top Box — ”
55772	55785	55786	55787	Draco Malfoy	290	“ For the first and last time in your life , Weasley . ”
55841	55853	55855	55855	Harry	248	“ Do n’t remember asking you to join us , Malfoy , ”
55858	55865	55867	55867	Malfoy	290	“ Weasley … what is that ? ”
55927	55932	55934	55934	Malfoy	290	“ Look at this ! ”
55949	55976	55945	55945	Crabbe	351	“ Weasley , you were n’t thinking of wearing these , were you ? I mean — they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety . … ”
55977	55983	55985	55985	Ron	196	“ Eat dung , Malfoy ! ”
56017	56064	55945	55945	Crabbe	351	“ So … going to enter , Weasley ? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name ? There ’s money involved as well , you know … you ’d be able to afford some decent robes if you won . … ”
56065	56072	56074	56074	Ron	196	“ What are you talking about ? ”
56076	56083	56084	56084	Malfoy	290	“ Are you going to enter ? ”
56087	56107	56084	56084	Malfoy	290	“ I suppose you will , Potter ? You never miss a chance to show off , do you ? ”
56108	56122	56124	56124	Hermione	186	“ Either explain what you ’re on about or go away , Malfoy , ”
56150	56160	56161	56161	he	290	“ Do n’t tell me you do n’t know ? ”
56165	56246	56161	56161	he	290	“ You ’ve got a father and brother at the Ministry and you do n’t even know ? My God , my father told me about it ages ago … heard it from Cornelius Fudge . But then , Father ’s always associated with the top people at the Ministry . … Maybe your father ’s too junior to know about it , Weasley … yes … they probably do n’t talk about important stuff in front of him . … ”
56285	56288	56290	56290	Hermione	186	“ Ron ! ”
56301	56304	56294	56294	she	186	“ Reparo ! ”
56321	56337	56338	56338	Ron	196	“ Well … making it look like he knows everything and we do n’t . … ”
56341	56375	56338	56338	Ron	196	“ ‘ Father ’s always associated with the top people at the Ministry . ’ … Dad could ’ve got a promotion any time … he just likes it where he is . … ”
56376	56382	56384	56384	Hermione	186	“ Of course he does , ”
56387	56398	56384	56384	Hermione	186	“ Do n’t let Malfoy get to you , Ron — ”
56399	56410	56412	56412	Ron	196	“ Him ! Get to me ! ? As if ! ”
56551	56556	56557	56557	Harry	162	“ Hi , Hagrid ! ”
56572	56579	56580	56580	Hagrid	205	“ All righ ’ , Harry ? ”
56586	56598	56580	56580	Hagrid	205	“ See yeh at the feast if we don ’ drown ! ”
56613	56627	56629	56629	Hermione	186	“ Oooh , I would n’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather , ”
56865	56868	56870	56870	Ron	196	“ Blimey , ”
56880	56898	56870	56870	Ron	196	“ if that keeps up the lake ’s going to overflow . I ’m soak — ARRGH ! ”
57030	57033	57069	57069	she	194	“ PEEVES ! ”
57039	57048	57069	57069	she	194	“ Peeves , come down here at ONCE ! ”
57087	57095	57069	57069	she	194	“ Ouch — sorry , Miss Granger — ”
57096	57104	57105	57105	Hermione	186	“ That ’s all right , Professor ! ”
57112	57120	57122	57123	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Peeves , get down here NOW ! ”
57139	57144	57146	57146	Peeves	354	“ Not doing nothing ! ”
57168	57181	57183	57183	he	354	“ Already wet , are n’t they ? Little squirts ! Wheeeeeeeeee ! ”
57198	57205	57207	57208	Professor McGonagall	194	“ I shall call the headmaster ! ”
57210	57218	57207	57208	Professor McGonagall	194	“ I ’m warning you , Peeves — ”
57247	57255	57257	57258	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Well , move along , then ! ”
57265	57274	57257	57258	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Into the Great Hall , come on ! ”
57487	57491	57492	57492	he	359	“ Good evening , ”
57499	57503	57505	57505	Harry	162	“ Says who ? ”
57517	57530	57505	57505	Harry	162	“ Hope they hurry up with the Sorting . I ’m starving . ”
57590	57595	57598	57599	Colin Creevey	361	“ Hiya , Harry ! ”
57613	57618	57620	57620	Harry	162	“ Hi , Colin , ”
57623	57643	57598	57599	Colin Creevey	361	“ Harry , guess what ? Guess what , Harry ? My brother ’s starting ! My brother Dennis ! ”
57644	57649	57651	57651	Harry	162	“ Er — good , ”
57653	57659	57661	57661	Colin	361	“ He ’s really excited ! ”
57672	57690	57661	57661	Colin	361	“ I just hope he ’s in Gryffindor ! Keep your fingers crossed , eh , Harry ? ”
57691	57699	57701	57701	Harry	162	“ Er — yeah , all right , ”
57716	57731	57732	57732	he	162	“ Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses , do n’t they ? ”
57752	57759	57761	57761	Hermione	186	“ Oh no , not necessarily , ”
57763	57789	57761	57761	Hermione	186	“ Parvati Patil ’s twin ’s in Ravenclaw , and they ’re identical . You ’d think they ’d be together , would n’t you ? ”
57859	57871	57873	57873	Hermione	186	“ Where ’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ? ”
57937	57945	57947	57947	Hermione	186	“ Maybe they could n’t get anyone ! ”
58239	58244	58245	58245	Ron	196	“ Oh hurry up , ”
58251	58258	58245	58245	Ron	196	“ I could eat a hippogriff . ”
58787	58800	58802	58802	Harry	162	“ That ’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us , ”
58810	58818	58820	58820	Ron	196	“ Sings a different one every year , ”
58822	58853	58820	58820	Ron	196	“ It ’s got to be a pretty boring life , has n’t it , being a hat ? I suppose it spends all year making up the next one . ”
58865	58885	58886	58886	she	194	“ When I call out your name , you will put on the hat and sit on the stool , ”
58892	58909	58886	58886	she	194	“ When the hat announces your House , you will go and sit at the appropriate table .
58910	58915	58916	58917	A boy	1889	“ Ackerley , Stewart ! ”
58945	58948	58886	58886	she	194	“ RAVENCLAW ! ”
59011	59016	58980	58980	Cho	268	“ Baddock , Malcolm ! ”
59017	59020	59048	59048	Baddock	374	“ SLYTHERIN ! ”
59076	59081	59069	59070	Malcolm Baddock	374	“ Branstone , Eleanor ! ”
59082	59085	59065	59065	Fred	200	“ HUFFLEPUFF ! ”
59086	59091	59069	59070	Malcolm Baddock	374	“ Cauldwell , Owen ! ”
59092	59095	59065	59065	Fred	200	“ HUFFLEPUFF ! ”
59096	59101	59069	59070	Malcolm Baddock	374	“ Creevey , Dennis ! ”
59219	59222	59186	59186	He	205	“ GRYFFINDOR ! ”
59260	59267	59268	59268	he	362	“ Colin , I fell in ! ”
59279	59299	59268	59268	he	362	“ It was brilliant ! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat ! ”
59300	59303	59305	59305	Colin	361	“ Cool ! ”
59311	59321	59305	59305	Colin	361	“ It was probably the giant squid , Dennis ! ”
59322	59325	59327	59327	Dennis	362	“ Wow ! ”
59366	59396	59305	59305	Colin	361	“ Dennis ! Dennis ! See that boy down there ? The one with the black hair and glasses ? See him ? Know who he is , Dennis ? ”
59452	59457	59458	59458	Ron	196	“ Oh hurry up , ”
59465	59479	59481	59483	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ Now , Ron , the Sorting ’s much more important than food , ”
59485	59490	59481	59483	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ Madley , Laura ! ”
59495	59506	59508	59508	Ron	196	“ ’ Course it is , if you ’re dead , ”
59510	59525	59527	59529	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ I do hope this year ’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch , ”
59533	59538	59527	59529	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ McDonald , Natalie ! ”
59544	59558	59527	59529	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ We do n’t want to break our winning streak , do we ? ”
59576	59581	59527	59529	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ Pritchard , Graham ! ”
59582	59585	59527	59529	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ SLYTHERIN ! ”
59586	59591	59527	59529	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ Quirke , Orla ! ”
59592	59595	59527	59529	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ RAVENCLAW ! ”
59600	59605	59527	59529	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ Whitby , Kevin ! ”
59607	59610	59527	59529	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ HUFFLEPUFF ! ”
59631	59635	59637	59637	Ron	196	“ About time , ”
59675	59686	59687	59687	he	195	“ I have only two words to say to you , ”
59699	59703	59687	59687	he	195	“ Tuck in . ”
59704	59709	59711	59711	Harry	162	“ Hear , hear ! ”
59742	59750	59752	59752	Ron	196	“ Aaah , ’ at ’s be’er , ”
59762	59777	59779	59781	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ You ’re lucky there ’s a feast at all tonight , you know , ”
59783	59792	59779	59781	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ There was trouble in the kitchens earlier . ”
59793	59801	59803	59803	Harry	162	“ Why ? Wha ’ ’ appened ? ”
59812	59818	59820	59822	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ Peeves , of course , ”
59844	59924	59832	59832	He	359	“ The usual argument , you know . He wanted to attend the feast — well , it ’s quite out of the question , you know what he ’s like , utterly uncivilized , ca n’t see a plate of food without throwing it . We held a ghost ’s council — the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance — but most wisely , in my opinion , the Bloody Baron put his foot down . ”
59956	59968	59970	59970	Ron	196	“ Yeah , we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something , ”
59973	59983	59970	59970	Ron	196	“ So what did he do in the kitchens ? ”
59984	59989	59991	59993	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ Oh the usual , ”
59997	60023	59991	59993	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ Wreaked havoc and mayhem . Pots and pans everywhere . Place swimming in soup . Terrified the house - elves out of their wits — ”
60056	60064	60065	60065	she	186	“ There are house - elves here ? ”
60079	60084	60065	60065	she	186	“ Here at Hogwarts ? ”
60085	60088	60090	60092	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ Certainly , ”
60100	60117	60090	60092	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ The largest number in any dwelling in Britain , I believe . Over a hundred . ”
60118	60125	60127	60127	Hermione	186	“ I ’ve never seen one ! ”
60129	60144	60146	60148	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ Well , they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day , do they ? ”
60150	60210	60146	60148	Nearly Headless Nick	359	“ They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning … see to the fires and so on . … I mean , you ’re not supposed to see them , are you ? That ’s the mark of a good house - elf , is n’t it , that you do n’t know it ’s there ? ”
60216	60222	60223	60223	she	186	“ But they get paid ? ”
60226	60247	60223	60223	she	186	“ They get holidays , do n’t they ? And — and sick leave , and pensions , and everything ? ”
60283	60289	60290	60290	he	359	“ Sick leave and pensions ? ”
60309	60321	60290	60290	he	359	“ House - elves do n’t want sick leave and pensions ! ”
60349	60361	60363	60363	Ron	196	“ Oh c’m on , ’ Er - my - knee , ”
60374	60382	60383	60383	He	196	“ Oops — sorry , ’ Arry — ”
60386	60398	60383	60383	He	196	“ You wo n’t get them sick leave by starving yourself ! ”
60399	60403	60405	60405	Hermione	186	“ Slave labor , ”
60413	60424	60405	60405	Hermione	186	“ That ’s what made this dinner . Slave labor . ”
60481	60487	60489	60489	Ron	196	“ Treacle tart , Hermione ! ”
60498	60507	60489	60489	Ron	196	“ Spotted dick , look ! Chocolate gateau ! ”
60580	60583	60585	60585	Dumbledore	195	“ So ! ”
60593	60603	60585	60585	Dumbledore	195	“ Now that we are all fed and watered , ”
60605	60608	60610	60610	Hermione	186	“ Hmph ! ”
60612	60629	60585	60585	Dumbledore	195	“ I must once more ask for your attention , while I give out a few notices .
60630	60707	60716	60716	He	195	“ Mr. Filch , the caretaker , has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include Screaming Yo - yos , Fanged Frisbees , and Ever - Bashing Boomerangs . The full list comprises some four hundred and thirty - seven items , I believe , and can be viewed in Mr. Filch ’s office , if anybody would like to check it . ”
60719	60757	60716	60716	He	195	“ As ever , I would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out - of - bounds to students , as is the village of Hogs meade to all below third year .
60758	60782	60806	60806	They	1913	“ It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter - House Quidditch Cup will not take place this year . ”
60783	60786	60787	60787	Harry	162	“ What ? ”
60823	60878	60819	60819	Dumbledore	195	“ This is due to an event that will be starting in October , and continuing throughout the school year , taking up much of the teachers ’ time and energy — but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely . I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts — ”
61366	61379	61381	61381	Dumbledore	195	“ May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ? ”
61387	61391	61381	61381	Dumbledore	195	“ Professor Moody . ”
61460	61463	61464	61464	Harry	162	“ Moody ? ”
61469	61485	61464	61464	Harry	162	“ Mad - Eye Moody ? The one your dad went to help this morning ? ”
61486	61490	61492	61492	Ron	196	“ Must be , ”
61500	61506	61507	61507	Hermione	186	“ What happened to him ? ”
61510	61517	61507	61507	Hermione	186	“ What happened to his face ? ”
61518	61521	61522	61522	Ron	196	“ Dunno , ”
61622	61628	61629	61629	he	195	“ As I was saying , ”
61654	61706	61649	61652	Mad - Eye Moody	344	“ we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months , an event that has not been held for over a century . It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year . ”
61707	61712	61714	61715	Fred Weasley	200	“ You ’re JOKING ! ”
61742	61751	61752	61752	he	195	“ I am not joking , Mr. Weasley , ”
61755	61789	61752	61752	he	195	“ though now that you mention it , I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll , a hag , and a leprechaun who all go into a bar … ”
61797	61810	61812	61812	Dumbledore	195	“ Er — but maybe this is not the time … no … ”
61814	61862	61812	61812	Dumbledore	195	“ where was I ? Ah yes , the Triwizard Tournament … well , some of you will not know what this tournament involves , so I hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation , and allow their attention to wander freely .
61863	61969	61812	61812	Dumbledore	195	“ The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry : Hogwarts , Beauxbatons , and Durmstrang . A champion was selected to represent each school , and the three champions competed in three magical tasks . The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years , and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities — until , that is , the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued . ”
61970	61974	61975	61975	Hermione	186	“ Death toll ? ”
62034	62048	62049	62049	Dumbledore	195	“ There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament , ”
62052	62108	62049	62049	Dumbledore	195	“ none of which has been very successful . However , our own departments of International Magical Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt . We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time , no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger .
62109	62172	62049	62049	Dumbledore	195	“ The heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their short - listed contenders in October , and the selection of the three champions will take place at Halloween . An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup , the glory of their school , and a thousand Galleons personal prize money . ”
62173	62180	62181	62182	Fred Weasley	200	“ I ’m going for it ! ”
62255	62273	62274	62274	he	195	“ Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts , ”
62277	62333	62274	62274	he	195	“ the heads of the participating schools , along with the Ministry of Magic , have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year . Only students who are of age — that is to say , seventeen years or older — will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration . This ”
62362	62427	62428	62428	His	195	“ is a measure we feel is necessary , given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous , whatever precautions we take , and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them . I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion . ”
62445	62462	62428	62428	His	195	“ I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen .
62463	62560	62428	62428	His	195	“ The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year . I know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us , and will give your whole - hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected . And now , it is late , and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning . Bedtime ! Chop chop ! ”
62601	62608	62610	62611	George Weasley	201	“ They ca n’t do that ! ”
62633	62648	62610	62611	George Weasley	201	“ We ’re seventeen in April , why ca n’t we have a shot ? ”
62649	62657	62659	62659	Fred	200	“ They ’re not stopping me entering , ”
62669	62695	62659	62659	Fred	200	“ The champions’ll get to do all sorts of stuff you ’d never be allowed to do normally . And a thousand Galleons prize money ! ”
62696	62699	62701	62701	Ron	196	“ Yeah , ”
62710	62717	62701	62701	Ron	196	“ Yeah , a thousand Galleons … ”
62718	62722	62724	62724	Hermione	186	“ Come on , ”
62726	62741	62724	62724	Hermione	186	“ we ’ll be the only ones left here if you do n’t move . ”
62780	62796	62798	62798	Harry	162	“ Who ’s this impartial judge who ’s going to decide who the champions are ? ”
62800	62803	62805	62805	Fred	200	“ Dunno , ”
62807	62834	62805	62805	Fred	200	“ but it ’s them we ’ll have to fool . I reckon a couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it , George . … ”
62835	62846	62848	62848	Ron	196	“ Dumbledore knows you ’re not of age , though , ”
62850	62869	62871	62871	Fred	200	“ Yeah , but he ’s not the one who decides who the champion is , is he ? ”
62874	62914	62871	62871	Fred	200	“ Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter , he ’ll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are . Dumbledore ’s trying to stop us giving our names . ”
62915	62922	62924	62924	Hermione	186	“ People have died , though ! ”
62947	62950	62952	62952	Fred	200	“ Yeah , ”
62955	62997	62952	62952	Fred	200	“ but that was years ago , was n’t it ? Anyway , where ’s the fun without a bit of risk ? Hey , Ron , what if we find out how to get ’ round Dumbledore ? Fancy entering ? ”
62998	63003	63004	63004	Ron	196	“ What d’you reckon ? ”
63008	63036	63006	63006	Harry	162	“ Be cool to enter , would n’t it ? But I s’pose they might want someone older . … Dunno if we ’ve learned enough . … ”
63037	63043	63045	63045	Neville	349	“ I definitely have n’t , ”
63055	63091	63045	63045	Neville	349	“ I expect my gran’d want me to try , though . She ’s always going on about how I should be upholding the family honor . I ’ll just have to — oops . … ”
63171	63177	63179	63179	Ron	196	“ Shut it , you , ”
63218	63221	63222	63222	she	1966	“ Password ? ”
63228	63231	63233	63233	George	201	“ Balderdash , ”
63235	63242	63233	63233	George	201	“ a prefect downstairs told me . ”
63294	63298	63292	63292	her	186	“ Slave labor , ”
63419	63422	63423	63423	Ron	196	“ Mental , ”
63485	63496	63497	63497	Ron	196	“ I might go in for it , you know , ”
63504	63524	63497	63497	Ron	196	“ if Fred and George find out how to … the tournament … you never know , do you ? ”
63525	63530	63497	63497	Ron	196	“ S’pose not . … ”
63719	63729	63731	63731	Ron	196	“ Today ’s not bad … outside all morning , ”
63746	63768	63731	63731	Ron	196	“ Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and Care of Magical Creatures … damn it , we ’re still with the Slytherins . … ”
63769	63775	63776	63776	Harry	162	“ Double Divination this afternoon , ”
63807	63821	63823	63823	Hermione	186	“ You should have given it up like me , should n’t you ? ”
63831	63842	63823	63823	Hermione	186	“ Then you ’d be doing something sensible like Arithmancy . ”
63843	63852	63854	63854	Ron	196	“ You ’re eating again , I notice , ”
63868	63884	63886	63886	Hermione	186	“ I ’ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights , ”
63889	63897	63899	63899	Ron	196	“ Yeah … and you were hungry , ”
64145	64148	64149	64150	Professor Sprout	366	“ Bubotubers , ”
64155	64166	64149	64150	Professor Sprout	366	“ They need squeezing . You will collect the pus — ”
64167	64171	64173	64174	Seamus Finnigan	263	“ The what ? ”
64179	64186	64188	64189	Professor Sprout	366	“ Pus , Finnigan , pus , ”
64191	64238	64188	64189	Professor Sprout	366	“ and it ’s extremely valuable , so do n’t waste it . You will collect the pus , I say , in these bottles . Wear your dragon - hide gloves ; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted , bubotuber pus . ”
64297	64305	64307	64308	Professor Sprout	366	“ This ’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy , ”
64318	64346	64307	64308	Professor Sprout	366	“ An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne , bubotuber pus . Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples . ”
64347	64353	64355	64356	Hannah Abbott	399	“ Like poor Eloise Midgen , ”
64366	64374	64355	64356	Hannah Abbott	399	“ She tried to curse hers off . ”
64375	64379	64381	64382	Professor Sprout	366	“ Silly girl , ”
64388	64401	64385	64385	her	366	“ But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end . ”
64538	64542	64543	64543	Hagrid	205	“ Mornin ’ ! ”
64555	64575	64543	64543	Hagrid	205	“ Be’er wait fer the Slytherins , they won ’ want ter miss this — Blast - Ended Skrewts ! ”
64576	64580	64582	64582	Ron	196	“ Come again ? ”
64591	64594	64596	64597	Lavender Brown	402	“ Eurgh ! ”
64602	64604	64584	64584	Hagrid	205	“ Eurgh ”
64722	64728	64730	64730	Hagrid	205	“ On’y jus ’ hatched , ”
64733	64755	64730	64730	Hagrid	205	“ so yeh’ll be able ter raise ’em yerselves ! Thought we ’d make a bit of a project of it ! ”
64756	64766	64793	64793	Hagrid	205	“ And why would we want to raise them ? ”
64800	64809	64811	64811	Malfoy	290	“ I mean , what do they do ? ”
64813	64821	64811	64811	Malfoy	290	“ What is the point of them ? ”
64844	64916	64840	64840	he	205	“ Tha ’s next lesson , Malfoy . Yer jus ’ feedin ’ ’em today . Now , yeh’ll wan ’ ter try ’em on a few diff’rent things — I ’ve never had ’em before , not sure what they ’ll go fer — I got ant eggs an ’ frog livers an ’ a bit o ’ grass snake — just try ’em out with a bit of each . ”
64917	64924	64926	64926	Seamus	263	“ First pus and now this , ”
64988	64991	64993	64994	Dean Thomas	174	“ Ouch ! ”
65000	65004	64993	64994	Dean Thomas	174	“ It got me !
65014	65019	65021	65021	Dean	174	“ Its end exploded ! ”
65032	65045	65047	65047	Hagrid	205	“ Ah , yeah , that can happen when they blast off , ”
65051	65054	65056	65057	Lavender Brown	402	“ Eurgh ! ”
65060	65073	65056	65057	Lavender Brown	402	“ Eurgh , Hagrid , what ’s that pointy thing on it ? ”
65074	65084	65086	65086	Hagrid	205	“ Ah , some of ’em have got stings , ”
65099	65128	65086	65086	Hagrid	205	“ I reckon they ’re the males . … The females’ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies . … I think they might be ter suck blood . ”
65129	65145	65147	65147	Malfoy	290	“ Well , I can certainly see why we ’re trying to keep them alive , ”
65150	65168	65147	65147	Malfoy	290	“ Who would n’t want pets that can burn , sting , and bite all at once ? ”
65169	65187	65188	65188	Hermione	186	“ Just because they ’re not very pretty , it does n’t mean they ’re not useful , ”
65191	65212	65188	65188	Hermione	186	“ Dragon blood ’s amazingly magical , but you would n’t want a dragon for a pet , would you ? ”
65291	65301	65303	65303	Ron	196	“ Well , at least the skrewts are small , ”
65320	65325	65327	65327	Hermione	186	“ They are now , ”
65333	65353	65327	65327	Hermione	186	“ but once Hagrid ’s found out what they eat , I expect they ’ll be six feet long . ”
65354	65374	65376	65376	Ron	196	“ Well , that wo n’t matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something , will it ? ”
65383	65397	65399	65399	Hermione	186	“ You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up , ”
65401	65434	65399	65399	Hermione	186	“ As a matter of fact I think he ’s right . The best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all . ”
65465	65477	65479	65479	Ron	196	“ Er — is this the new stand on elf rights ? ”
65481	65491	65479	65479	Ron	196	“ You ’re going to make yourself puke instead ? ”
65492	65495	65504	65504	she	186	“ No , ”
65514	65524	65504	65504	she	186	“ I just want to get to the library . ”
65525	65528	65530	65530	Ron	196	“ What ? ”
65534	65552	65530	65530	Ron	196	“ Hermione — it ’s the first day back ! We have n’t even got homework yet ! ”
65580	65586	65572	65572	she	186	“ See you at dinner ! ”
65727	65731	65737	65738	Professor Trelawney	335	“ Good day , ”
65804	65812	65813	65813	she	335	“ You are preoccupied , my dear , ”
65819	65879	65813	65813	she	335	“ My inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within . And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless . I see difficult times ahead for you , alas … most difficult … I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass … and perhaps sooner than you think . … ”
65942	65956	65957	65957	she	335	“ My dears , it is time for us to consider the stars , ”
65960	65997	65957	65957	she	335	“ The movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance . Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays , which intermingle … ”
66049	66064	66042	66042	she	335	“ ‘ I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass … ’ ”
66189	66192	66193	66193	Ron	196	“ Harry ! ”
66196	66199	66193	66193	Ron	196	“ What ? ”
66232	66252	66254	66255	Professor Trelawney	335	“ I was saying , my dear , that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn , ”
66279	66287	66289	66289	Harry	162	“ Born under — what , sorry ? ”
66291	66300	66302	66303	Professor Trelawney	335	“ Saturn , dear , the planet Saturn ! ”
66317	66374	66309	66309	he	162	“ I was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth . … Your dark hair … your mean stature … tragic losses so young in life … I think I am right in saying , my dear , that you were born in midwinter ? ”
66375	66378	66380	66380	Harry	162	“ No , ”
66382	66389	66380	66380	Harry	162	“ I was born in July . ”
66448	66456	66458	66458	Harry	162	“ I ’ve got two Neptunes here , ”
66471	66481	66458	66458	Harry	162	“ that ca n’t be right , can it ? ”
66482	66485	66487	66487	Ron	196	“ Aaaaah , ”
66496	66521	66487	66487	Ron	196	“ when two Neptunes appear in the sky , it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born , Harry … ”
66547	66571	66544	66545	Lavender Brown	402	“ Oh Professor , look ! I think I ’ve got an unaspected planet ! Oooh , which one ’s that , Professor ? ”
66572	66580	66582	66583	Professor Trelawney	335	“ It is Uranus , my dear , ”
66591	66603	66605	66605	Ron	196	“ Can I have a look at Uranus too , Lavender ? ”
66637	66662	66663	66663	she	335	“ A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you , with reference to your personal chart , ”
66680	66695	66663	66663	she	335	“ I want it ready to hand in next Monday , and no excuses ! ”
66696	66701	66703	66703	Ron	196	“ Miserable old bat , ”
66721	66732	66703	66703	Ron	196	“ That ’ll take all weekend , that will . … ”
66733	66738	66740	66740	Hermione	186	“ Lots of homework ? ”
66748	66759	66740	66740	Hermione	186	“ Professor Vector did n’t give us any at all ! ”
66760	66768	66770	66770	Ron	196	“ Well , bully for Professor Vector , ”
66807	66814	66820	66820	Hermione	186	“ Weasley ! Hey , Weasley ! ”
66840	66843	66845	66845	Ron	196	“ What ? ”
66848	66858	66860	66860	Malfoy	290	“ Your dad ’s in the paper , Weasley ! ”
66885	66889	66860	66860	Malfoy	290	“ Listen to this !
66972	66972	66973	66973	Malfoy	290	”
66977	67004	67005	67005	he	290	“ Imagine them not even getting his name right , Weasley . It ’s almost as though he ’s a complete nonentity , is n’t it ? ”
67057	67059	67051	67055	several Muggle law - keepers	2034	“ policemen ”
67079	67083	67069	67070	Mr. Weasley	198	“ Mad - Eye ”
67177	67186	67188	67188	Malfoy	290	“ And there ’s a picture , Weasley ! ”
67199	67232	67188	67188	Malfoy	290	“ A picture of your parents outside their house — if you can call it a house ! Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight , could n’t she ? ”
67245	67251	67253	67253	Harry	162	“ Get stuffed , Malfoy , ”
67255	67262	67253	67253	Harry	162	“ C’m on , Ron . … ”
67263	67281	67283	67283	Malfoy	290	“ Oh yeah , you were staying with them this summer , were n’t you , Potter ? ”
67285	67304	67283	67283	Malfoy	290	“ So tell me , is his mother really that porky , or is it just the picture ? ”
67305	67313	67315	67315	Harry	162	“ You know your mother , Malfoy ? ”
67338	67371	67334	67334	himself	196	“ that expression she ’s got , like she ’s got dung under her nose ? Has she always looked like that , or was it just because you were with her ? ”
67380	67391	67334	67334	himself	196	“ Do n’t you dare insult my mother , Potter . ”
67392	67401	67403	67403	Harry	162	“ Keep your fat mouth shut , then , ”
67463	67471	67472	67472	Harry	162	“ OH NO YOU DON’T , LADDIE ! ”
67565	67571	67572	67572	Moody	394	“ Did he get you ? ”
67582	67585	67587	67587	Harry	162	“ No , ”
67589	67592	67587	67587	Harry	162	“ missed . ”
67593	67597	67598	67598	Moody	394	“ LEAVE IT ! ”
67601	67606	67607	67607	Harry	162	“ Leave — what ? ”
67612	67618	67619	67619	Moody	394	“ Not you — him ! ”
67691	67698	67700	67700	Moody	394	“ I do n’t think so ! ”
67733	67749	67751	67751	Moody	394	“ I do n’t like people who attack when their opponent ’s back ’s turned , ”
67764	67775	67751	67751	Moody	394	“ Stinking , cowardly , scummy thing to do . … ”
67790	67799	67801	67801	Moody	394	“ Never — do — that — again — ”
67818	67822	67873	67873	her	194	“ Professor Moody ! ”
67843	67849	67851	67851	Moody	394	“ Hello , Professor McGonagall , ”
67860	67868	67870	67871	Professor McGonagall	194	“ What — what are you doing ? ”
67885	67888	67890	67890	Moody	394	“ Teaching , ”
67892	67902	67904	67905	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Teach — Moody , is that a student ? ”
67915	67918	67920	67920	Moody	394	“ Yep , ”
67922	67925	67927	67928	Professor McGonagall	194	“ No ! ”
67983	67994	67996	67997	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Moody , we never use Transfiguration as a punishment ! ”
68000	68008	67996	67997	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that ? ”
68009	68018	68020	68020	Moody	394	“ He might ’ve mentioned it , yeah , ”
68027	68036	68020	68020	Moody	394	“ but I thought a good sharp shock — ”
68037	68054	67996	67997	Professor McGonagall	194	“ We give detentions , Moody ! Or speak to the offender ’s Head of House ! ”
68055	68063	68065	68065	Moody	394	“ I ’ll do that , then , ”
68099	68102	68074	68074	Malfoy	290	“ my father ”
68106	68110	68112	68112	Moody	394	“ Oh yeah ? ”
68133	68179	68125	68125	his	394	“ Well , I know your father of old , boy . … You tell him Moody ’s keeping a close eye on his son … you tell him that from me . … Now , your Head of House’ll be Snape , will it ? ”
68180	68183	68185	68185	Malfoy	290	“ Yes , ”
68188	68193	68195	68195	Moody	394	“ Another old friend , ”
68197	68217	68195	68195	Moody	394	“ I ’ve been looking forward to a chat with old Snape . … Come on , you . … ”
68267	68274	68275	68275	Ron	196	“ Do n’t talk to me , ”
68308	68312	68314	68314	Hermione	186	“ Why not ? ”
68318	68330	68332	68332	Ron	196	“ Because I want to fix that in my memory forever , ”
68345	68354	68332	68332	Ron	196	“ Draco Malfoy , the amazing bouncing ferret … ”
68373	68383	68384	68384	she	186	“ He could have really hurt Malfoy , though , ”
68387	68400	68384	68384	she	186	“ It was good , really , that Professor McGonagall stopped it — ”
68401	68404	68406	68406	Ron	196	“ Hermione ! ”
68415	68426	68406	68406	Ron	196	“ you ’re ruining the best moment of my life ! ”
68441	68456	68458	68458	Harry	162	“ Do n’t tell me you ’re going back to the library this evening ? ”
68463	68467	68469	68469	Hermione	186	“ Got to , ”
68472	68477	68469	68469	Hermione	186	“ Loads to do . ”
68478	68486	68469	68469	Hermione	186	“ But you told us Professor Vector — ”
68487	68493	68494	68494	she	186	“ It ’s not schoolwork , ”
68523	68526	68527	68527	he	2052	“ Moody ! ”
68530	68536	68527	68527	he	2052	“ How cool is he ? ”
68537	68541	68543	68543	George	201	“ Beyond cool , ”
68550	68553	68561	68562	Lee Jordan	396	“ Supercool , ”
68571	68578	68579	68579	he	396	“ We had him this afternoon , ”
68585	68591	68593	68593	Harry	162	“ What was it like ? ”
68608	68616	68618	68618	Fred	200	“ Never had a lesson like it , ”
68620	68626	68628	68628	Lee	396	“ He knows , man , ”
68630	68634	68636	68636	Ron	196	“ Knows what ? ”
68641	68654	68656	68656	George	201	“ Knows what it ’s like to be out there doing it , ”
68659	68663	68665	68665	Harry	162	“ Doing what ? ”
68667	68673	68675	68675	Fred	200	“ Fighting the Dark Arts , ”
68677	68684	68686	68686	George	201	“ He ’s seen it all , ”
68688	68692	68694	68694	Lee	396	“ ’ Mazing , ”
68705	68714	68715	68715	he	196	“ We have n’t got him till Thursday ! ”
68791	68807	68809	68809	Ron	196	“ You know why Snape ’s in such a foul mood , do n’t you ? ”
68831	68834	68836	68836	Harry	162	“ Yeah , ”
68838	68841	68836	68836	Harry	162	“ Moody . ”
68939	68953	68954	68954	Harry	162	“ I reckon Snape ’s a bit scared of him , you know , ”
68958	68969	68971	68971	Ron	196	“ Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad , ”
68978	68988	68971	68971	Ron	196	“ and bounced him all around his dungeon . … ”
69040	69045	69081	69082	the teacher	2064	“ Been in the — ”
69046	69049	69050	69050	Harry	162	“ Library . ”
69057	69071	69050	69050	Harry	162	“ C’m on , quick , or we wo n’t get decent seats . ”
69150	69157	69158	69158	he	394	“ You can put those away , ”
69170	69180	69158	69158	he	394	“ those books . You wo n’t need them . ”
69247	69251	69252	69252	he	394	“ Right then , ”
69264	69311	69252	69252	he	394	“ I ’ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class . Seems you ’ve had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures — you ’ve covered boggarts , Red Caps , hinkypunks , grindylows , Kappas , and werewolves , is that right ? ”
69320	69334	69336	69336	Moody	394	“ But you ’re behind — very behind — on dealing with curses , ”
69338	69372	69336	69336	Moody	394	“ So I ’m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other . I ’ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark — ”
69373	69381	69382	69382	Ron	196	“ What , are n’t you staying ? ”
69458	69469	69470	69470	Moody	394	“ You ’ll be Arthur Weasley ’s son , eh ? ”
69473	69517	69470	69470	Moody	394	“ Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago . … Yeah , I ’m staying just the one year . Special favor to Dumbledore . … One year , and then back to my quiet retirement . ”
69532	69724	69518	69518	He	394	“ So — straight into it . Curses . They come in many strengths and forms . Now , according to the Ministry of Magic , I ’m supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that . I ’m not supposed to show you what illegal Dark curses look like until you ’re in the sixth year . You ’re not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then . But Professor Dumbledore ’s got a higher opinion of your nerves , he reckons you can cope , and I say , the sooner you know what you ’re up against , the better . How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you ’ve never seen ? A wizard who ’s about to put an illegal curse on you is n’t going to tell you what he ’s about to do . He ’s not going to do it nice and polite to your face . You need to be prepared . You need to be alert and watchful . You need to put that away , Miss Brown , when I ’m talking . ”
69764	69782	69798	69798	Moody	394	“ So … do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding law ? ”
69813	69816	69818	69818	Ron	196	“ Er , ”
69821	69840	69818	69818	Ron	196	“ my dad told me about one . … Is it called the Imperius Curse , or something ? ”
69841	69846	69848	69848	Moody	394	“ Ah , yes , ”
69851	69874	69848	69848	Moody	394	“ Your father would know that one . Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time , the Imperius Curse . ”
69957	69960	69947	69947	He	394	“ Imperio ! ”
70050	70059	70060	70060	he	394	“ Think it ’s funny , do you ? ”
70063	70079	70060	70060	he	394	“ You ’d like it , would you , if I did it to you ? ”
70087	70091	70093	70093	Moody	394	“ Total control , ”
70109	70131	70093	70093	Moody	394	“ I could make it jump out of the window , drown itself , throw itself down one of your throats … ”
70138	70157	70159	70159	Moody	394	“ Years back , there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse , ”
70179	70206	70164	70164	he	394	“ Some job for the Ministry , trying to sort out who was being forced to act , and who was acting of their own free will .
70207	70251	70252	70252	he	394	“ The Imperius Curse can be fought , and I ’ll be teaching you how , but it takes real strength of character , and not everyone ’s got it . Better avoid being hit with it if you can . CONSTANT VIGILANCE ! ”
70273	70283	70259	70259	Moody	394	“ Anyone else know one ? Another illegal curse ? ”
70332	70335	70337	70337	Moody	394	“ Yes ? ”
70350	70359	70361	70361	Neville	349	“ There ’s one — the Cruciatus Curse , ”
70383	70389	70390	70390	he	394	“ Your name ’s Longbottom ? ”
70450	70455	70457	70457	Moody	394	“ The Cruciatus Curse , ”
70459	70473	70474	70474	he	394	“ Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea , ”
70484	70487	70474	70474	he	394	“ Engorgio ! ”
70535	70538	70520	70520	Moody	394	“ Crucio ! ”
70609	70613	70614	70614	Hermione	186	“ Stop it ! ”
70686	70689	70690	70690	Moody	394	“ Reducio , ”
70711	70714	70716	70716	Moody	394	“ Pain , ”
70719	70746	70716	70716	Moody	394	“ You do n’t need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse . … That one was very popular once too .
70747	70755	70703	70703	He	394	“ Right … anyone know any others ? ”
70803	70806	70808	70808	Moody	394	“ Yes ? ”
70814	70818	70819	70819	Hermione	186	“ Avada Kedavra , ”
70833	70836	70838	70838	Moody	394	“ Ah , ”
70848	70863	70844	70844	his	394	“ Yes , the last and worst . Avada Kedavra … the Killing Curse . ”
70938	70942	70943	70943	Moody	394	“ Avada Kedavra ! ”
71024	71028	71029	71029	he	394	“ Not nice , ”
71033	71068	71029	71029	he	394	“ Not pleasant . And there ’s no countercurse . There ’s no blocking it . Only one known person has ever survived it , and he ’s sitting right in front of me . ”
71400	71463	71396	71396	Moody	394	“ Avada Kedavra ’s a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it — you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words , and I doubt I ’d get so much as a nosebleed . But that does n’t matter . I ’m not here to teach you how to do it .
71464	71515	71516	71516	he	394	“ Now , if there ’s no countercurse , why am I showing you ? Because you ’ve got to know . You ’ve got to appreciate what the worst is . You do n’t want to find yourself in a situation where you ’re facing it . CONSTANT VIGILANCE ! ”
71526	71624	71516	71516	he	394	“ Now … those three curses — Avada Kedavra , Imperius , and Cruciatus — are known as the Unforgivable Curses . The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban . That ’s what you ’re up against . That ’s what I ’ve got to teach you to fight . You need preparing . You need arming . But most of all , you need to practice constant , never - ceasing vigilance . Get out your quills … copy this down . … ”
71679	71686	71669	71670	Most people	2103	“ Did you see it twitch ? ”
71687	71699	71700	71700	They	2100	“ — and when he killed it — just like that ! ”
71739	71743	71744	71744	she	186	“ Hurry up , ”
71752	71759	71761	71761	Ron	196	“ Not the ruddy library again ? ”
71763	71766	71768	71768	Hermione	186	“ No , ”
71777	71780	71768	71768	Hermione	186	“ Neville . ”
71818	71821	71822	71822	Hermione	186	“ Neville ? ”
71830	71834	71835	71835	he	349	“ Oh hello , ”
71845	71871	71835	71835	he	349	“ Interesting lesson , was n’t it ? I wonder what ’s for dinner , I ’m — I ’m starving , are n’t you ? ”
71872	71880	71882	71882	Hermione	186	“ Neville , are you all right ? ”
71884	71892	71893	71893	Neville	349	“ Oh yes , I ’m fine , ”
71902	71916	71893	71893	Neville	349	“ Very interesting dinner — I mean lesson — what ’s for eating ? ”
71924	71930	71917	71917	Ron	196	“ Neville , what — ? ”
71982	71990	71991	71991	he	394	“ It ’s all right , sonny , ”
71996	72019	71991	71991	he	394	“ Why do n’t you come up to my office ? Come on … we can have a cup of tea . … ”
72047	72057	72039	72039	Moody	394	“ You all right , are you , Potter ? ”
72058	72061	72063	72063	Harry	162	“ Yes , ”
72086	72127	72083	72083	he	394	“ You ’ve got to know . It seems harsh , maybe , but you ’ve got to know . No point pretending … well … come on , Longbottom , I ’ve got some books that might interest you . ”
72170	72176	72178	72178	Ron	196	“ What was that about ? ”
72188	72194	72196	72196	Hermione	186	“ I do n’t know , ”
72201	72209	72211	72211	Ron	196	“ Some lesson , though , eh ? ”
72223	72264	72211	72211	Ron	196	“ Fred and George were right , were n’t they ? He really knows his stuff , Moody , does n’t he ? When he did Avada Kedavra , the way that spider just died , just snuffed it right — ”
72373	72394	72395	72395	Harry	162	“ Would n’t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we ’d seen the curses ? ”
72404	72409	72411	72411	Ron	196	“ Yeah , probably , ”
72413	72454	72411	72411	Ron	196	“ But Dumbledore ’s always done things his way , has n’t he , and Moody ’s been getting in trouble for years , I reckon . Attacks first and asks questions later — look at his dustbins . Balderdash . ”
72481	72491	72493	72493	Harry	162	“ Shall we get our Divination stuff , then ? ”
72495	72499	72500	72500	Ron	196	“ I s’pose , ”
72556	72563	72564	72564	Harry	162	“ You all right , Neville ? ”
72568	72572	72574	72574	Neville	349	“ Oh yes , ”
72576	72593	72574	72574	Neville	349	“ I ’m fine , thanks . Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me . … ”
72607	72622	72623	72623	Neville	349	“ Apparently , Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I ’m really good at Herbology , ”
72644	72652	72634	72634	his	349	“ He thought I ’d like this . ”
72779	72794	72795	72795	he	162	“ I have n’t got a clue what this lot ’s supposed to mean , ”
72807	72811	72813	72813	Ron	196	“ You know , ”
72835	72847	72813	72813	Ron	196	“ I think it ’s back to the old Divination standby . ”
72848	72855	72890	72890	he	196	“ What — make it up ? ”
72856	72859	72861	72861	Ron	196	“ Yeah , ”
72885	72889	72890	72890	he	196	“ Next Monday , ”
72896	72915	72916	72916	He	196	“ I am likely to develop a cough , owing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter . ”
72922	72940	72916	72916	He	196	“ You know her — just put in loads of misery , she ’ll lap it up . ”
72941	72944	72946	72946	Harry	162	“ Right , ”
72970	72987	72946	72946	Harry	162	“ Okay … on Monday , I will be in danger of — er — burns . ”
72988	72995	72997	72997	Ron	196	“ Yeah , you will be , ”
73000	73019	72997	72997	Ron	196	“ we ’re seeing the skrewts again on Monday . Okay , Tuesday , I ’ll … erm … ”
73020	73026	73028	73028	Harry	162	“ Lose a treasured possession , ”
73040	73044	73046	73046	Ron	196	“ Good one , ”
73052	73077	73046	73046	Ron	196	“ Because of … erm … Mercury . Why do n’t you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend ? ”
73078	73083	73085	73085	Harry	162	“ Yeah … cool … ”
73091	73101	73085	73085	Harry	162	“ because … Venus is in the twelfth house . ”
73102	73118	73046	73046	Ron	196	“ And on Wednesday , I think I ’ll come off worst in a fight . ”
73119	73138	73085	73085	Harry	162	“ Aaah , I was going to have a fight . Okay , I ’ll lose a bet . ”
73139	73153	73046	73046	Ron	196	“ Yeah , you ’ll be betting I ’ll win my fight . … ”
73426	73442	73406	73406	his	2123	“ No — that sounds like we ’re accusing him . Got to be careful … ”
73544	73547	73548	73548	she	186	“ Hello , ”
73551	73557	73548	73548	she	186	“ I ’ve just finished ! ”
73558	73563	73565	73565	Ron	196	“ So have I ! ”
73596	73609	73610	73610	she	186	“ Not going to have a very good month , are you ? ”
73621	73631	73632	73632	Ron	196	“ Ah well , at least I ’m forewarned , ”
73635	73643	73645	73645	Hermione	186	“ You seem to be drowning twice , ”
73647	73652	73654	73654	Ron	196	“ Oh am I ? ”
73662	73678	73654	73654	Ron	196	“ I ’d better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff . ”
73679	73695	73697	73697	Hermione	186	“ Do n’t you think it ’s a bit obvious you ’ve made these up ? ”
73699	73704	73706	73706	Ron	196	“ How dare you ! ”
73712	73723	73706	73706	Ron	196	“ We ’ve been working like house - elves here ! ”
73729	73736	73738	73738	Ron	196	“ It ’s just an expression , ”
73758	73765	73766	73766	he	162	“ What ’s in the box ? ”
73773	73779	73781	73781	Hermione	186	“ Funny you should ask , ”
73820	73825	73827	73827	Harry	162	“ ‘ Spew ’ ? ”
73838	73844	73827	73827	Harry	162	“ What ’s this about ? ”
73845	73849	73851	73851	Hermione	186	“ Not spew , ”
73854	73875	73851	73851	Hermione	186	“ It ’s S - P - E - W. Stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare . ”
73876	73882	73884	73884	Ron	196	“ Never heard of it , ”
73886	73895	73897	73897	Hermione	186	“ Well , of course you have n’t , ”
73900	73908	73897	73897	Hermione	186	“ I ’ve only just started it . ”
73909	73912	73914	73914	Ron	196	“ Yeah ? ”
73919	73927	73914	73914	Ron	196	“ How many members have you got ? ”
73928	73938	73940	73940	Hermione	186	“ Well — if you two join — three , ”
73942	73961	73963	73963	Ron	196	“ And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying ‘ spew , ’ do you ? ”
73965	73974	73976	73976	Hermione	186	“ S - P - E - W ! ”
73979	74019	73976	73976	Hermione	186	“ I was going to put Stop the Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal Status — but it would n’t fit . So that ’s the heading of our manifesto . ”
74029	74060	74020	74020	She	186	“ I ’ve been researching it thoroughly in the library . Elf enslavement goes back centuries . I ca n’t believe no one ’s done anything about it before now . ”
74061	74068	74070	74070	Ron	196	“ Hermione — open your ears , ”
74073	74085	74070	74070	Ron	196	“ They . Like . It . They like being enslaved ! ”
74086	74093	74095	74095	Hermione	186	“ Our short - term aims , ”
74115	74167	74108	74108	she	186	“ are to secure house - elves fair wages and working conditions . Our long - term aims include changing the law about non - wand use , and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures , because they ’re shockingly underrepresented . ”
74168	74177	74178	74178	Harry	162	“ And how do we do all this ? ”
74181	74188	74190	74190	Hermione	186	“ We start by recruiting members , ”
74193	74258	74190	74190	Hermione	186	“ I thought two Sickles to join — that buys a badge — and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign . You ’re treasurer , Ron — I ’ve got you a collecting tin upstairs — and Harry , you ’re secretary , so you might want to write down everything I ’m saying now , as a record of our first meeting . ”
74348	74351	74352	74352	he	162	“ Hedwig ! ”
74394	74398	74400	74400	Harry	162	“ About time ! ”
74406	74413	74415	74415	Ron	196	“ She ’s got an answer ! ”
74451	74457	74458	74458	Hermione	186	“ What does it say ? ”
74588	74594	74595	74595	Hermione	186	“ He ’s flying north ? ”
74598	74604	74595	74595	Hermione	186	“ He ’s coming back ? ”
74605	74612	74614	74614	Ron	196	“ Dumbledore ’s reading what signs ? ”
74619	74626	74614	74614	Ron	196	“ Harry — what ’s up ? ”
74647	74655	74656	74656	Harry	162	“ I should n’t ’ve told him ! ”
74660	74667	74669	74669	Ron	196	“ What are you on about ? ”
74673	74686	74688	74688	Harry	162	“ It ’s made him think he ’s got to come back ! ”
74712	74741	74742	74742	Harry	162	“ Coming back , because he thinks I ’m in trouble ! And there ’s nothing wrong with me ! And I have n’t got anything for you , ”
74754	74769	74750	74750	her	187	“ you ’ll have to go up to the Owlery if you want food . ”
74798	74801	74802	74802	Hermione	186	“ Harry , ”
74812	74819	74821	74821	Harry	162	“ I ’m going to bed , ”
74824	74831	74821	74821	Harry	162	“ See you in the morning . ”
75376	75384	75385	75385	Harry	162	“ Just find him , all right ? ”
75407	75413	75385	75385	Harry	162	“ Before the dementors do . ”
75490	75498	75500	75500	Hermione	186	“ That was a lie , Harry , ”
75516	75529	75500	75500	Hermione	186	“ You did n’t imagine your scar hurting and you know it . ”
75530	75534	75536	75536	Harry	162	“ So what ? ”
75538	75550	75536	75536	Harry	162	“ He ’s not going back to Azkaban because of me . ”
75551	75555	75557	75557	Ron	196	“ Drop it , ”
75748	75760	75762	75762	Hermione	186	“ But — but you said it ’s illegal , Professor , ”
75789	75801	75774	75774	his	394	“ You said — to use it against another human was — ”
75802	75812	75814	75814	Moody	394	“ Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like , ”
75832	75868	75816	75816	his	394	“ If you ’d rather learn the hard way — when someone ’s putting it on you so they can control you completely — fine by me . You ’re excused . Off you go . ”
76019	76022	76023	76023	Moody	394	“ Potter , ”
76026	76030	76023	76023	Moody	394	“ you next . ”
76064	76067	76051	76051	Moody	394	“ Imperio ! ”
76283	76292	76294	76294	Moody	394	“ Now , that ’s more like it ! ”
76330	76396	76313	76313	He	162	“ Look at that , you lot … Potter fought ! He fought it , and he damn near beat it ! We ’ll try that again , Potter , and the rest of you , pay attention — watch his eyes , that ’s where you see it — very good , Potter , very good indeed ! They ’ll have trouble controlling you ! ”
76397	76403	76404	76404	Harry	162	“ The way he talks , ”
76447	76461	76422	76422	Moody	394	“ you ’d think we were all going to be attacked any second . ”
76462	76468	76470	76470	Ron	196	“ Yeah , I know , ”
76506	76511	76512	76512	Ron	196	“ Talk about paranoid … ”
76531	76593	76512	76512	Ron	196	“ No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry . Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted ‘ Boo ’ behind him on April Fools ’ Day ? And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we ’ve got to do ? ”
76639	76653	76654	76654	she	194	“ You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education ! ”
76667	76676	76654	76654	she	194	“ Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer — ”
76677	76687	76689	76690	Dean Thomas	174	“ We do n’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year ! ”
76693	76756	76654	76654	she	194	“ Maybe not , Thomas , but believe me , you need all the preparation you can get ! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion . I might remind you that your pincushion , Thomas , still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin ! ”
76977	76980	76968	76968	Hagrid	205	“ project , ”
77004	77009	77011	77012	Draco Malfoy	290	“ I will not , ”
77036	77049	77023	77024	Father Christmas	232	“ I see enough of these foul things during lessons , thanks . ”
77058	77066	77067	77067	he	205	“ Yeh’ll do wha ’ yer told , ”
77070	77096	77067	77067	he	205	“ or I ’ll be takin ’ a leaf outta Professor Moody ’s book . … I hear yeh made a good ferret , Malfoy . ”
77272	77275	77277	77277	Harry	162	“ Brilliant ! ”
77279	77298	77277	77277	Harry	162	“ It ’s Potions last thing on Friday ! Snape wo n’t have time to poison us all ! ”
77325	77331	77343	77343	his	267	“ Only a week away ! ”
77347	77363	77343	77343	his	267	“ I wonder if Cedric knows ? Think I ’ll go and tell him . … ”
77364	77367	77369	77369	Ron	196	“ Cedric ? ”
77376	77379	77381	77381	Harry	162	“ Diggory , ”
77383	77391	77381	77381	Harry	162	“ He must be entering the tournament . ”
77392	77399	77401	77401	Ron	196	“ That idiot , Hogwarts champion ? ”
77415	77435	77437	77437	Hermione	186	“ He ’s not an idiot . You just do n’t like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch , ”
77439	77456	77437	77437	Hermione	186	“ I ’ve heard he ’s a really good student — and he ’s a prefect . ”
77466	77476	77478	77478	Ron	196	“ You only like him because he ’s handsome , ”
77481	77496	77498	77498	Hermione	186	“ Excuse me , I do n’t like people just because they ’re handsome ! ”
77512	77515	77501	77501	Ron	196	“ Lockhart ! ”
77703	77727	77728	77729	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Longbottom , kindly do not reveal that you ca n’t even perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang ! ”
77905	77914	77915	77915	George	201	“ It ’s a bummer , all right , ”
77922	77961	77915	77915	George	201	“ But if he wo n’t talk to us in person , we ’ll have to send him the letter after all . Or we ’ll stuff it into his hand . He ca n’t avoid us forever . ”
77962	77968	77970	77970	Ron	196	“ Who ’s avoiding you ? ”
77978	77983	77985	77985	Fred	200	“ Wish you would , ”
77993	77999	78000	78000	Ron	196	“ What ’s a bummer ? ”
78004	78015	78017	78017	George	201	“ Having a nosy git like you for a brother , ”
78019	78031	78032	78032	Harry	162	“ You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet ? ”
78035	78044	78032	78032	Harry	162	“ Thought any more about trying to enter ? ”
78045	78060	78062	78062	George	201	“ I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she was n’t telling , ”
78065	78081	78062	78062	George	201	“ She just told me to shut up and get on with transfiguring my raccoon . ”
78082	78092	78094	78094	Ron	196	“ Wonder what the tasks are going to be ? ”
78097	78118	78094	78094	Ron	196	“ You know , I bet we could do them , Harry . We ’ve done dangerous stuff before . … ”
78119	78133	78135	78135	Fred	200	“ Not in front of a panel of judges , you have n’t , ”
78137	78155	78135	78135	Fred	200	“ McGonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well they ’ve done the tasks . ”
78156	78162	78163	78163	Harry	162	“ Who are the judges ? ”
78166	78181	78183	78183	Hermione	186	“ Well , the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel , ”
78195	78224	78190	78190	her	186	“ because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792 , when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage . ”
78252	78306	78236	78236	her	186	“ It ’s all in Hogwarts , A History . Though , of course , that book ’s not entirely reliable . A Revised History of Hogwarts would be a more accurate title . Or A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts , Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School . ”
78307	78314	78316	78316	Ron	196	“ What are you on about ? ”
78327	78332	78336	78336	her	186	“ House - elves ! ”
78340	78369	78336	78336	her	186	“ Not once , in over a thousand pages , does Hogwarts , A History mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves ! ”
78502	78536	78537	78537	she	186	“ You do realize that your sheets are changed , your fires lit , your classrooms cleaned , and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved ? ”
78640	78654	78631	78631	George	201	“ Listen , have you ever been down in the kitchens , Hermione ? ”
78655	78662	78664	78664	Hermione	186	“ No , of course not , ”
78667	78676	78664	78664	Hermione	186	“ I hardly think students are supposed to — ”
78677	78683	78685	78685	George	201	“ Well , we have , ”
78690	78722	78685	78685	George	201	“ loads of times , to nick food . And we ’ve met them , and they ’re happy . They think they ’ve got the best job in the world — ”
78723	78733	78734	78734	Hermione	186	“ That ’s because they ’re uneducated and brainwashed ! ”
78923	78932	78933	78933	Ron	196	“ Why d’you have to keep changing owls ? ”
78940	78947	78949	78949	Hermione	186	“ Hedwig’ll attract too much attention , ”
78953	78982	78949	78949	Hermione	186	“ She stands out . A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he ’s hiding … I mean , they ’re not native birds , are they ? ”
79054	79059	79060	79060	he	162	“ Thanks , Hedwig , ”
79204	79211	79212	79213	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Weasley , straighten your hat , ”
79218	79231	79212	79213	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Miss Patil , take that ridiculous thing out of your hair . ”
79247	79253	79255	79256	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Follow me , please , ”
79258	79268	79255	79256	Professor McGonagall	194	“ First years in front … no pushing . … ”
79338	79342	79344	79344	Ron	196	“ Nearly six , ”
79362	79373	79344	79344	Ron	196	“ How d’you reckon they ’re coming ? The train ? ”
79374	79379	79381	79381	Hermione	186	“ I doubt it , ”
79383	79390	79391	79391	Harry	162	“ How , then ? Broomsticks ? ”
79401	79415	79344	79344	Ron	196	“ I do n’t think so … not from that far away . … ”
79416	79420	79421	79421	Ron	196	“ A Portkey ? ”
79424	79444	79421	79421	Ron	196	“ Or they could Apparate — maybe you ’re allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from ? ”
79445	79464	79466	79466	Hermione	186	“ You ca n’t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds , how often do I have to tell you ? ”
79535	79552	79521	79522	Mr. Weasley	198	“ always the same — we ca n’t resist showing off when we get together . … ”
79570	79586	79563	79563	he	195	“ Aha ! Unless I am very much mistaken , the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches ! ”
79587	79590	79592	79593	many students	2237	“ Where ? ”
79602	79605	79607	79609	a sixth year	2238	“ There ! ”
79650	79656	79665	79665	her	2241	“ It ’s a dragon ! ”
79669	79681	79683	79684	Dennis Creevey	362	“ Do n’t be stupid … it ’s a flying house ! ”
80209	80215	80216	80216	he	195	“ My dear Madame Maxime , ”
80219	80224	80216	80216	he	195	“ Welcome to Hogwarts . ”
80225	80230	80232	80233	Madame Maxime	322	“ Dumbly - dorr , ”
80239	80248	80232	80233	Madame Maxime	322	“ I ’ ope I find you well ? ”
80249	80258	80260	80260	Dumbledore	195	“ In excellent form , I thank you , ”

80412	80420	80422	80422	Dumbledore	195	“ He should be here any moment , ”
80424	80447	80422	80422	Dumbledore	195	“ Would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle ? ”
80448	80455	80457	80458	Madame Maxime	322	“ Warm up , I think , ”
80460	80466	80457	80458	Madame Maxime	322	“ But ze ’ orses — ”
80467	80483	80485	80485	Dumbledore	195	“ Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them , ”
80487	80512	80485	80485	Dumbledore	195	“ the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other — er — charges . ”
80513	80516	80517	80517	Ron	196	“ Skrewts , ”
80524	80535	80537	80538	Madame Maxime	322	“ My steeds require — er — forceful ’ andling , ”
80561	80568	80543	80543	she	322	“ Zey are very strong . … ”

80665	80678	80679	80680	Seamus Finnigan	263	“ How big d’you reckon Durmstrang ’s horses are going to be ? ”
80694	80716	80718	80718	Harry	162	“ Well , if they ’re any bigger than this lot , even Hagrid wo n’t be able to handle them , ”
80720	80740	80718	80718	Harry	162	“ That ’s if he has n’t been attacked by his skrewts . Wonder what ’s up with them ? ”
80741	80747	80749	80749	Ron	196	“ Maybe they ’ve escaped , ”
80752	80759	80761	80761	Hermione	186	“ Oh do n’t say that , ”
80766	80776	80761	80761	Hermione	186	“ Imagine that lot loose on the grounds . … ”
80825	80831	80833	80833	Ron	196	“ Can you hear something ? ”
80875	80879	80881	80882	Lee Jordan	396	“ The lake ! ”
80889	80895	80881	80882	Lee Jordan	396	“ Look at the lake ! ”

81268	81281	81258	81258	he	2298	“ How are you , my dear fellow , how are you ? ”

81514	81521	81522	81522	Ron	196	“ I do n’t believe it ! ”

81554	81569	81571	81571	Hermione	186	“ For heaven ’s sake , Ron , he ’s only a Quidditch player , ”
81573	81579	81580	81580	Ron	196	“ Only a Quidditch player ? ”
81595	81619	81580	81580	Ron	196	“ Hermione — he ’s one of the best Seekers in the world ! I had no idea he was still at school ! ”
81680	81698	81666	81670	Several sixth - year girls	2313	“ Oh I do n’t believe it , I have n’t got a single quill on me — ”
81699	81710	81666	81670	Several sixth - year girls	2313	“ D’you think he ’d sign my hat in lipstick ? ”
81711	81714	81715	81715	Hermione	186	“ Really , ”
81730	81740	81742	81742	Ron	196	“ I ’m getting his autograph if I can , ”
81744	81757	81742	81742	Ron	196	“ You have n’t got a quill , have you , Harry ? ”
81758	81768	81770	81770	Harry	162	“ Nope , they ’re upstairs in my bag , ”
81855	81862	81864	81864	Hermione	186	“ It ’s not that cold , ”
81867	81875	81864	81864	Hermione	186	“ Why did n’t they bring cloaks ? ”
81876	81886	81887	81887	Ron	196	“ Over here ! Come and sit over here ! ”
81890	81903	81887	81887	Ron	196	“ Over here ! Hermione , budge up , make a space — ”

81959	81973	81975	81975	Ron	196	“ Yeah , that ’s right , smarm up to him , Malfoy , ”
81978	82040	81975	81975	Ron	196	“ I bet Krum can see right through him , though … bet he gets people fawning over him all the time . … Where d’you reckon they ’re going to sleep ? We could offer him a space in our dormitory , Harry … I would n’t mind giving him my bed , I could kip on a camp bed . ”
82044	82055	82057	82057	Harry	162	“ They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot , ”
82147	82156	82157	82157	Harry	162	“ But there are only two extra people , ”
82160	82174	82157	82157	Harry	162	“ Why ’s Filch putting out four chairs , who else is coming ? ”
82175	82178	82180	82180	Ron	196	“ Eh ? ”
82300	82316	82318	82318	Dumbledore	195	“ Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , ghosts and — most particularly — guests , ”
82327	82354	82318	82318	Dumbledore	195	“ I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts . I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable . ”

82409	82426	82407	82407	Dumbledore	195	“ I now invite you all to eat , drink , and make yourselves at home ! ”
82497	82502	82504	82504	Ron	196	“ What ’s that ? ”

82544	82549	82551	82551	Hermione	186	“ It ’s French , ”
82553	82568	82551	82551	Hermione	186	“ I had it on holiday summer before last . It ’s very nice . ”
82569	82578	82580	82580	Ron	196	“ I ’ll take your word for it , ”
82697	82705	82706	82706	Harry	162	“ Skrewts doing all right , Hagrid ? ”
82709	82713	82714	82714	Hagrid	205	“ Thrivin ’ , ”
82719	82729	82731	82731	Ron	196	“ Yeah , I ’ll just bet they are , ”
82734	82754	82731	82731	Ron	196	“ Looks like they ’ve finally found a food they like , does n’t it ? Hagrid ’s fingers . ”
82763	82773	82774	82774	It	2346	“ Excuse me , are you wanting ze bouillabaisse ? ”
82850	82856	82858	82858	Harry	162	“ Yeah , have it , ”
82867	82875	82858	82858	Harry	162	“ You ’ ave finished wiz it ? ”
82876	82879	82880	82880	Ron	196	“ Yeah , ”
82884	82891	82880	82880	Ron	196	“ Yeah , it was excellent . ”
82940	82946	82947	82947	he	196	“ She ’s a veela ! ”
82953	82960	82962	82962	Hermione	186	“ Of course she is n’t ! ”
82965	82979	82962	82962	Hermione	186	“ I do n’t see anyone else gaping at her like an idiot ! ”
83017	83030	83032	83032	Ron	196	“ I ’m telling you , that ’s not a normal girl ! ”
83046	83057	83037	83037	he	196	“ They do n’t make them like that at Hogwarts ! ”
83058	83066	83068	83068	Harry	162	“ They make them okay at Hogwarts , ”
83090	83101	83103	83103	Hermione	186	“ When you ’ve both put your eyes back in , ”
83106	83118	83103	83103	Hermione	186	“ you ’ll be able to see who ’s just arrived . ”
83164	83171	83173	83173	Harry	248	“ What are they doing here ? ”
83177	83188	83190	83190	Hermione	186	“ They organized the Triwizard Tournament , did n’t they ? ”
83192	83205	83190	83190	Hermione	186	“ I suppose they wanted to be here to see it start . ”
83336	83342	83344	83344	Dumbledore	195	“ The moment has come , ”
83355	83381	83344	83344	Dumbledore	195	“ The Triwizard Tournament is about to start . I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket — ”
83382	83386	83387	83387	Harry	248	“ The what ? ”
83393	83435	83344	83344	Dumbledore	195	“ — just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year . But first , let me introduce , for those who do not know them , Mr. Bartemius Crouch , Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation ”
83445	83461	83344	83344	Dumbledore	195	“ and Mr. Ludo Bagman , Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports . ”
83560	83582	83583	83583	Dumbledore	195	“ Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament , ”
83586	83611	83583	83583	Dumbledore	195	“ and they will be joining myself , Professor Karkaroff , and Madame Maxime on the panel that will judge the champions ’ efforts . ”
83618	83621	83644	83644	he	195	“ champions , ”
83647	83660	83641	83641	he	195	“ The casket , then , if you please , Mr. Filch . ”
83731	83754	83756	83756	Dumbledore	195	“ The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman , ”
83769	83828	83758	83758	Filch	391	“ and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge . There will be three tasks , spaced throughout the school year , and they will test the champions in many different ways … their magical prowess — their daring — their powers of deduction — and , of course , their ability to cope with danger . ”
83850	83862	83863	83863	Dumbledore	195	“ As you know , three champions compete in the tournament , ”
83868	83922	83863	83863	Dumbledore	195	“ one from each of the participating schools . They will be marked on how well they perform each of the Tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup . The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector : the Goblet of Fire . ”
84008	84035	84037	84037	Dumbledore	195	“ Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet , ”
84039	84102	84037	84037	Dumbledore	195	“ Aspiring champions have twenty - four hours in which to put their names forward . Tomorrow night , Halloween , the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools . The goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight , where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete .
84103	84114	84116	84116	Dumbledore	195	“ To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation , ”
84118	84154	84116	84116	Dumbledore	195	“ I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall . Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line .
84155	84274	84037	84037	Dumbledore	195	“ Finally , I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly . Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire , he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end . The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding , magical contract . There can be no change of heart once you have become a champion . Please be very sure , therefore , that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet . Now , I think it is time for bed . Good night to you all . ”
84275	84280	84281	84282	Fred Weasley	200	“ An Age Line ! ”
84306	84346	84285	84285	his	195	“ Well , that should be fooled by an Aging Potion , should n’t it ? And once your name ’s in that goblet , you ’re laughing — it ca n’t tell whether you ’re seventeen or not ! ”
84347	84361	84363	84363	Hermione	186	“ But I do n’t think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance , ”
84365	84373	84363	84363	Hermione	186	“ we just have n’t learned enough … ”
84374	84379	84381	84381	George	201	“ Speak for yourself , ”
84384	84398	84381	84381	George	201	“ You ’ll try and get in , wo n’t you , Harry ? ”
84456	84461	84463	84463	Ron	196	“ Where is he ? ”
84489	84504	84487	84487	Krum	234	“ Dumbledore did n’t say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping , did he ? ”
84532	84540	84541	84541	he	430	“ Back to the ship , then , ”
84545	84569	84541	84541	he	430	“ Viktor , how are you feeling ? Did you eat enough ? Should I send for some mulled wine from the kitchens ? ”
84584	84593	84595	84600	one of the other Durmstrang boys	2378	“ Professor , I vood like some vine , ”
84603	84614	84616	84616	Karkaroff	430	“ I was n’t offering it to you , Poliakoff , ”
84627	84646	84618	84618	his	430	“ I notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again , disgusting boy — ”
84681	84685	84687	84687	Karkaroff	430	“ Thank you , ”
84799	84807	84816	84817	Professor Karkaroff	430	“ Yeah , that ’s Harry Potter , ”
84868	84871	84872	84872	he	430	“ You ! ”
84887	84890	84892	84892	Moody	344	“ Me , ”
84895	84921	84892	84892	Moody	344	“ And unless you ’ve got anything to say to Potter , Karkaroff , you might want to move . You ’re blocking the doorway . ”

85122	85128	85129	85129	she	2395	“ All the Durmstrang lot , ”
85132	85143	85129	85129	she	2395	“ But I have n’t seen anyone from Hogwarts yet . ”
85144	85162	85164	85164	Harry	162	“ Bet some of them put it in last night after we ’d all gone to bed , ”
85166	85195	85164	85164	Harry	162	“ I would ’ve if it had been me … would n’t have wanted everyone watching . What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again ? ”
85225	85229	85230	85230	Fred	200	“ Done it , ”
85244	85249	85230	85230	Fred	200	“ Just taken it . ”
85250	85253	85255	85255	Ron	196	“ What ? ”
85257	85265	85267	85267	Fred	200	“ The Aging Potion , dung brains , ”
85269	85274	85276	85276	George	201	“ One drop each , ”
85285	85296	85276	85276	George	201	“ We only need to be a few months older . ”
85297	85317	85319	85319	Lee	396	“ We ’re going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us wins , ”
85324	85338	85340	85340	Hermione	186	“ I ’m not sure this is going to work , you know , ”
85342	85353	85340	85340	Hermione	186	“ I ’m sure Dumbledore will have thought of this . ”
85363	85366	85367	85367	Fred	200	“ Ready ? ”
85378	85389	85367	85367	Fred	200	“ C’m on , then — I ’ll go first — ”
85600	85606	85628	85628	He	195	“ I did warn you , ”
85638	85696	85634	85634	his	195	“ I suggest you both go up to Madam Pomfrey . She is already tending to Miss Fawcett , of Ravenclaw , and Mr. Summers , of Hufflepuff , both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too . Though I must say , neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours . ”
85796	85814	85815	85815	Dean	174	“ There ’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in , ”
85819	85831	85815	85815	Dean	174	“ That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth . ”
85847	85856	85842	85842	his	162	“ We ca n’t have a Slytherin champion ! ”
85857	85867	85869	85869	Seamus	263	“ And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory , ”
85872	85889	85869	85869	Seamus	263	“ But I would n’t have thought he ’d have wanted to risk his good looks . ”
85890	85893	85895	85895	Hermione	186	“ Listen ! ”
85956	85970	85944	85944	Angelina	435	“ Well , I ’ve done it ! Just put my name in ! ”
85971	85976	85978	85978	Ron	196	“ You ’re kidding ! ”
85983	85990	85992	85992	Harry	162	“ Are you seventeen , then ? ”
85994	86009	86011	86011	Ron	196	“ ’ Course she is , ca n’t see a beard , can you ? ”
86013	86021	86023	86023	Angelina	435	“ I had my birthday last week , ”
86025	86037	86039	86039	Hermione	186	“ Well , I ’m glad someone from Gryffindor ’s entering , ”
86041	86051	86039	86039	Hermione	186	“ I really hope you get it , Angelina ! ”

86092	86103	86104	86104	Ron	196	“ What ’re we going to do today , then ? ”
86121	86132	86134	86134	Harry	162	“ We have n’t been down to visit Hagrid yet , ”
86136	86139	86141	86141	Ron	196	“ Okay , ”
86143	86162	86141	86141	Ron	196	“ just as long as he does n’t ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts . ”
86175	86191	86192	86192	she	186	“ I ’ve just realized — I have n’t asked Hagrid to join S.P.E.W. yet ! ”
86196	86213	86192	86192	she	186	“ Wait for me , will you , while I nip upstairs and get the badges ? ”
86214	86221	86223	86223	Ron	196	“ What is it with her ? ”
86236	86241	86243	86243	Harry	162	“ Hey , Ron , ”
86246	86252	86243	86243	Harry	162	“ It ’s your friend … ”
86347	86360	86361	86361	Ron	196	“ What d’you reckon’ll happen to the ones who are n’t chosen ? ”
86379	86396	86371	86371	her	2422	“ Reckon they ’ll go back to school , or hang around to watch the tournament ? ”
86397	86400	86402	86402	Harry	162	“ Dunno , ”
86404	86423	86402	86402	Harry	162	“ Hang around , I suppose . … Madame Maxime ’s staying to judge , is n’t she ? ”
86450	86458	86460	86460	Ron	196	“ Where are they sleeping , then ? ”
86489	86496	86498	86498	Ron	196	“ Oh good , hurry up , ”

86638	86647	86628	86628	Hagrid	205	“ Thought you lot’d forgotten where I live ! ”
86648	86657	86665	86665	she	186	“ We ’ve been really busy , Hag — ”
86790	86798	86787	86787	she	186	“ Erm — where are the skrewts ? ”
86799	86806	86808	86808	Hagrid	205	“ Out by the pumpkin patch , ”
86811	86839	86808	86808	Hagrid	205	“ They ’re gettin ’ massive , mus ’ be nearly three foot long now . On’y trouble is , they ’ve started killin ’ each other . ”
86840	86846	86848	86848	Hermione	186	“ Oh no , really ? ”
86877	86880	86882	86882	Hagrid	205	“ Yeah , ”

86908	86915	86917	86917	Ron	196	“ Well , that ’s lucky , ”
87011	87015	87016	87016	he	205	“ You wait , ”
87021	87052	87016	87016	he	205	“ You jus ’ wait . Yer going ter see some stuff yeh’ve never seen before . Firs ’ task … ah , but I ’m not supposed ter say . ”
87053	87059	87060	87060	Harry	162	“ Go on , Hagrid ! ”

87093	87131	87091	87091	Hagrid	205	“ But it ’s gon na be spectacular , I ’ll tell yeh that . Them champions’re going ter have their work cut out . Never thought I ’d live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again ! ”
87283	87294	87295	87295	he	205	“ It ’d be doin’ ’em an unkindness , Hermione , ”
87309	87352	87295	87295	he	205	“ It ’s in their nature ter look after humans , that ’s what they like , see ? Yeh’d be makin ’ ’em unhappy ter take away their work , an ’ insultin ’ ’em if yeh tried ter pay ’em . ”
87353	87369	87371	87371	Hermione	186	“ But Harry set Dobby free , and he was over the moon about it ! ”
87373	87384	87371	87371	Hermione	186	“ And we heard he ’s asking for wages now ! ”
87385	87431	87295	87295	he	205	“ Yeah , well , yeh get weirdos in every breed . I ’m not sayin ’ there is n’t the odd elf who ’d take freedom , but yeh’ll never persuade most of ’em ter do it — no , nothin’ doin’ , Hermione . ”
87493	87500	87502	87502	Hagrid	205	“ I ’ll come with yeh , ”
87509	87517	87502	87502	Hagrid	205	“ Jus ’ give us a sec . ”
87562	87569	87559	87559	Ron	196	“ Hagrid , what ’s that ? ”
87570	87573	87575	87575	Hagrid	205	“ Eh ? ”
87587	87594	87575	87575	Hagrid	205	“ Don ’ yeh like it ? ”
87595	87600	87602	87602	Hermione	186	“ Is that aftershave ? ”
87609	87616	87617	87617	Hagrid	205	“ Er — eau de cologne , ”
87624	87632	87633	87633	he	205	“ Maybe it ’s a bit much , ”
87637	87647	87633	87633	he	205	“ I ’ll go take it off , hang on …
87670	87675	87677	87677	Hermione	186	“ Eau de cologne ? ”
87681	87684	87677	87677	Hermione	186	“ Hagrid ? ”
87685	87696	87698	87698	Harry	162	“ And what ’s with the hair and the suit ? ”
87703	87706	87708	87708	Ron	196	“ Look ! ”
87841	87852	87854	87854	Hermione	186	“ He ’s going up to the castle with her ! ”
87857	87866	87854	87854	Hermione	186	“ I thought he was waiting for us ! ”
87906	87911	87913	87913	Ron	196	“ He fancies her ! ”
87916	87945	87913	87913	Ron	196	“ Well , if they end up having children , they ’ll be setting a world record — bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton . ”
87982	87990	87991	87991	Hermione	186	“ Ooh it ’s them , look ! ”
88115	88121	88123	88123	Fred	200	“ Hope it ’s Angelina , ”
88134	88139	88141	88141	Hermione	186	“ So do I ! ”
88144	88152	88141	88141	Hermione	186	“ Well , we ’ll soon know ! ”
88329	88342	88344	88344	Dumbledore	195	“ Well , the goblet is almost ready to make its decision , ”
88346	88394	88396	88396	he	195	“ I estimate that it requires one more minute . Now , when the champions ’ names are called , I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall , walk along the staff table , and go through into the next chamber ”
88405	88415	88396	88396	he	195	“ where they will be receiving their first instructions . ”
88499	88503	88504	88505	Lee Jordan	396	“ Any second , ”
88594	88600	88601	88601	he	195	“ The champion for Durmstrang , ”
88611	88617	88601	88601	he	195	“ will be Viktor Krum . ”
88618	88623	88625	88625	Ron	196	“ No surprises there ! ”
88672	88677	88687	88687	him	430	“ Bravo , Viktor ! ”
88695	88702	88687	88687	him	430	“ Knew you had it in you !
88746	88752	88754	88754	Dumbledore	195	“ The champion for Beauxbatons , ”
88756	88761	88754	88754	Dumbledore	195	“ is Fleur Delacour ! ”
88762	88769	88770	88770	Harry	248	“ It ’s her , Ron ! ”
88805	88814	88815	88815	Hermione	186	“ Oh look , they ’re all disappointed , ”
88830	88832	88815	88815	Hermione	186	“ Disappointed ”
88941	88946	88947	88947	he	195	“ The Hogwarts champion , ”
88950	88955	88947	88947	he	195	“ is Cedric Diggory ! ”
88956	88959	88961	88961	Ron	196	“ No ! ”
89042	89045	89046	89046	Dumbledore	195	“ Excellent ! ”
89057	89113	89046	89046	Dumbledore	195	“ Well , we now have our three champions . I am sure I can count upon all of you , including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang , to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster . By cheering your champion on , you will contribute in a very real — ”
89233	89237	89227	89227	his	195	“ Harry Potter . ”
89384	89393	89394	89394	Harry	440	“ I did n’t put my name in , ”
89398	89405	89394	89394	Harry	440	“ You know I did n’t . ”
89431	89435	89436	89436	he	195	“ Harry Potter ! ”
89440	89450	89436	89436	he	195	“ Harry ! Up here , if you please ! ”
89451	89455	89456	89456	Hermione	186	“ Go on , ”
89569	89578	89580	89580	Dumbledore	195	“ Well … through the door , Harry , ”
89809	89814	89815	89815	she	439	“ What is it ? ”
89818	89828	89815	89815	she	439	“ Do zey want us back in ze Hall ? ”
89901	89904	89905	89905	he	162	“ Extraordinary ! ”
89913	89921	89922	89922	he	162	“ Absolutely extraordinary ! Gentlemen … lady , ”
89934	89950	89922	89922	he	162	“ May I introduce — incredible though it may seem — the fourth Triwizard champion ? ”
90004	90014	89996	89996	her	439	“ Oh , vairy funny joke , Meester Bagman . ”
90015	90018	90019	90019	Bagman	441	“ Joke ? ”
90024	90045	90019	90019	Bagman	441	“ No , no , not at all ! Harry ’s name just came out of the Goblet of Fire ! ”
90063	90073	90074	90074	she	439	“ But evidently zair ’ as been a mistake , ”
90080	90093	90074	90074	she	439	“ ’ E can not compete . ’ E is too young . ”
90094	90101	90103	90103	Bagman	441	“ Well … it is amazing , ”
90115	90186	90103	90103	Bagman	441	“ But , as you know , the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure . And as his name ’s come out of the goblet … I mean , I do n’t think there can be any ducking out at this stage . … It ’s down in the rules , you ’re obliged … Harry will just have to do the best he — ”
90249	90253	90255	90255	Fleur	439	“ Madame Maxime ! ”
90265	90278	90255	90255	Fleur	439	“ Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also ! ”
90332	90344	90345	90345	she	322	“ What is ze meaning of zis , Dumbly - dorr ? ”
90349	90361	90366	90366	He	430	“ I ’d rather like to know that myself , Dumbledore , ”
90383	90413	90374	90374	his	430	“ Two Hogwarts champions ? I do n’t remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions — or have I not read the rules carefully enough ? ”
90422	90426	90428	90429	Madame Maxime	322	“ C’est impossible , ”
90446	90461	90428	90429	Madame Maxime	322	“ ’ Ogwarts can not ’ ave two champions . It is most injust . ”
90462	90480	90482	90482	Karkaroff	430	“ We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger contestants , Dumbledore , ”
90499	90521	90482	90482	Karkaroff	430	“ Otherwise , we would , of course , have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools . ”
90522	90535	90537	90537	Snape	368	“ It ’s no one ’s fault but Potter ’s , Karkaroff , ”
90548	90573	90540	90540	His	368	“ Do n’t go blaming Dumbledore for Potter ’s determination to break rules . He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here — ”
90574	90580	90582	90582	Dumbledore	195	“ Thank you , Severus , ”
90635	90649	90650	90650	he	368	“ Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire , Harry ? ”
90654	90657	90659	90659	Harry	162	“ No , ”
90683	90701	90703	90704	Professor Dumbledore	195	“ Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you ? ”
90709	90712	90714	90714	Harry	162	“ No , ”
90717	90728	90730	90731	Madame Maxime	322	“ Ah , but of course ’ e is lying ! ”
90744	90754	90756	90757	Professor McGonagall	194	“ He could not have crossed the Age Line , ”
90760	90771	90756	90757	Professor McGonagall	194	“ I am sure we are all agreed on that — ”
90772	90786	90788	90789	Madame Maxime	322	“ Dumbly - dorr must ’ ave made a mistake wiz ze line , ”
90793	90801	90803	90803	Dumbledore	195	“ It is possible , of course , ”
90805	90819	90821	90822	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Dumbledore , you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake ! ”
90825	90871	90821	90822	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Really , what nonsense ! Harry could not have crossed the line himself , and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him , I ’m sure that should be good enough for everybody else ! ”
90882	90889	90893	90893	his	430	“ Mr. Crouch … Mr. Bagman , ”
90899	90919	90893	90893	his	430	“ you are our — er — objective judges . Surely you will agree that this is most irregular ? ”
90990	91022	90985	90985	his	230	“ We must follow the rules , and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament . ”
91023	91035	91037	91037	Bagman	230	“ Well , Barty knows the rule book back to front , ”
91057	91071	91073	91073	Karkaroff	430	“ I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students , ”
91095	91127	91086	91086	His	430	“ You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more , and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions . It ’s only fair , Dumbledore . ”
91128	91139	91141	91141	Bagman	230	“ But Karkaroff , it does n’t work like that , ”
91143	91165	91141	91141	Bagman	230	“ The Goblet of Fire ’s just gone out — it wo n’t reignite until the start of the next tournament — ”
91166	91178	91180	91180	Karkaroff	430	“ — in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing ! ”
91182	91211	91180	91180	Karkaroff	430	“ After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises , I little expected something of this nature to occur ! I have half a mind to leave now ! ”
91212	91218	91141	91141	Bagman	230	“ Empty threat , Karkaroff , ”
91227	91261	91141	91141	Bagman	230	“ You ca n’t leave your champion now . He ’s got to compete . They ’ve all got to compete . Binding magical contract , like Dumbledore said . Convenient , eh ? ”
91289	91292	91294	91294	Karkaroff	430	“ Convenient ? ”
91296	91308	91294	91294	Karkaroff	430	“ I ’m afraid I do n’t understand you , Moody . ”
91345	91350	91352	91352	Moody	344	“ Do n’t you ? ”
91355	91382	91352	91352	Moody	344	“ It ’s very simple , Karkaroff . Someone put Potter ’s name in that goblet knowing he ’d have to compete if it came out . ”
91383	91400	91402	91403	Madame Maxime	322	“ Evidently , someone ’ oo wished to give ’ Ogwarts two bites at ze apple ! ”
91405	91413	91415	91415	Karkaroff	430	“ I quite agree , Madame Maxime , ”
91421	91439	91415	91415	Karkaroff	430	“ I shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards — ”
91440	91453	91455	91455	Moody	344	“ If anyone ’s got reason to complain , it ’s Potter , ”
91457	91473	91455	91455	Moody	344	“ but … funny thing … I do n’t hear him saying a word . … ”
91474	91481	91488	91488	her	439	“ Why should ’ e complain ? ”
91491	91543	91488	91488	her	439	“ ’ E ’ as ze chance to compete , ’ asn’t ’ e ? We ’ ave all been ’ oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks ! Ze honor for our schools ! A thousand Galleons in prize money — zis is a chance many would die for ! ”
91544	91557	91559	91559	Moody	344	“ Maybe someone ’s hoping Potter is going to die for it , ”
91598	91610	91593	91593	his	230	“ Moody , old man … what a thing to say ! ”
91611	91634	91636	91636	Karkaroff	430	“ We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he has n’t discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime , ”
91639	91674	91636	91636	Karkaroff	430	“ Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too . An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher , Dumbledore , but no doubt you had your reasons . ”
91675	91682	91684	91684	Moody	394	“ Imagining things , am I ? ”
91686	91710	91684	91684	Moody	394	“ Seeing things , eh ? It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy ’s name in that goblet . … ”
91711	91721	91723	91724	Madame Maxime	322	“ Ah , what evidence is zere of zat ? ”
91732	91742	91744	91744	Moody	394	“ Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object ! ”
91746	91798	91744	91744	Moody	394	“ It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament . … I ’m guessing they submitted Potter ’s name under a fourth school , to make sure he was the only one in his category . … ”
91799	91814	91816	91816	Karkaroff	430	“ You seem to have given this a great deal of thought , Moody , ”
91819	91881	91816	91816	Karkaroff	430	“ and a very ingenious theory it is — though of course , I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg , and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock . So you ’ll understand if we do n’t take you entirely seriously . … ”
91882	91895	91896	91896	Moody	394	“ There are those who ’ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage , ”
91903	91925	91896	91896	Moody	394	“ It ’s my job to think the way Dark wizards do , Karkaroff — as you ought to remember . … ”
91926	91929	91931	91931	Dumbledore	195	“ Alastor ! ”
91948	91952	91940	91940	he	162	“ Mad - Eye ”
91979	91990	91992	91992	Dumbledore	195	“ How this situation arose , we do not know , ”
92002	92042	91992	91992	Dumbledore	195	“ It seems to me , however , that we have no choice but to accept it . Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the Tournament . This , therefore , they will do . … ”
92043	92051	92083	92083	she	322	“ Ah , but Dumbly - dorr — ”
92052	92072	91992	91992	Dumbledore	195	“ My dear Madame Maxime , if you have an alternative , I would be delighted to hear it . ”
92110	92120	92121	92121	he	230	“ Well , shall we crack on , then ? ”
92134	92155	92121	92121	he	230	“ Got to give our champions their instructions , have n’t we ? Barty , want to do the honors ? ”
92167	92170	92171	92171	he	230	“ Yes , ”
92174	92183	92171	92171	he	230	“ instructions . Yes … the first task … ”
92228	92239	92240	92240	he	230	“ The first task is designed to test your daring , ”
92251	92283	92249	92249	Viktor	234	“ so we are not going to be telling you what it is . Courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard … very important . …
92284	92309	92240	92240	he	230	“ The first task will take place on November the twenty - fourth , in front of the other students and the panel of judges .
92310	92388	92249	92249	Viktor	234	“ The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament . The champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands . They will receive information about the second task when the first is over . Owing to the demanding and time - consuming nature of the tournament , the champions are exempted from end - of - year tests . ”
92397	92409	92249	92249	Viktor	234	“ I think that ’s all , is it , Albus ? ”
92410	92415	92417	92417	Dumbledore	195	“ I think so , ”
92429	92445	92417	92417	Dumbledore	195	“ Are you sure you would n’t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight , Barty ? ”
92446	92459	92461	92462	Mr. Crouch	248	“ No , Dumbledore , I must get back to the Ministry , ”
92464	92501	92461	92462	Mr. Crouch	248	“ It is a very busy , very difficult time at the moment . … I ’ve left young Weatherby in charge . … Very enthusiastic … a little overenthusiastic , if truth be told . … ”
92502	92517	92519	92519	Dumbledore	195	“ You ’ll come and have a drink before you go , at least ? ”
92521	92531	92533	92533	Bagman	230	“ Come on , Barty , I ’m staying ! ”
92536	92557	92533	92533	Bagman	230	“ It ’s all happening at Hogwarts now , you know , much more exciting here than at the office ! ”
92558	92565	92567	92567	Crouch	278	“ I think not , Ludo , ”
92576	92586	92588	92588	Dumbledore	195	“ Professor Karkaroff — Madame Maxime — a nightcap ? ”
92647	92660	92662	92662	Dumbledore	195	“ Harry , Cedric , I suggest you go up to bed , ”
92670	92707	92662	92662	Dumbledore	195	“ I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you , and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise . ”
92747	92750	92752	92752	Cedric	247	“ So , ”
92759	92768	92752	92752	Cedric	247	“ We ’re playing against each other again ! ”
92769	92773	92775	92775	Harry	248	“ I s’pose , ”
92807	92813	92815	92815	Cedric	247	“ So … tell me … ”
92839	92848	92815	92815	Cedric	247	“ How did you get your name in ? ”
92849	92854	92856	92856	Harry	248	“ I did n’t , ”
92863	92877	92856	92856	Harry	248	“ I did n’t put it in . I was telling the truth . ”
92878	92883	92885	92885	Cedric	247	“ Ah … okay , ”
92896	92904	92890	92890	Cedric	247	“ Well … see you , then . ”
93373	93380	93382	93384	the Fat Lady	2112	“ Well , well , well , ”
93386	93405	93382	93384	the Fat Lady	2112	“ Violet ’s just told me everything . Who ’s just been chosen as school champion , then ? ”
93406	93409	93411	93411	Harry	248	“ Balderdash , ”
93414	93421	93423	93425	the pale witch	2553	“ It most certainly is n’t ! ”
93428	93440	93442	93444	the Fat Lady	2112	“ No , no , Vi , it ’s the password , ”
93521	93531	93533	93533	Fred	200	“ You should ’ve told us you ’d entered ! ”
93544	93557	93559	93559	George	201	“ How did you do it without getting a beard ? Brilliant ! ”
93561	93566	93567	93567	Harry	248	“ I did n’t , ”
93570	93577	93567	93567	Harry	248	“ I do n’t know how — ”
93587	93603	93579	93579	Angelina	435	“ Oh if it could n’t be me , at least it ’s a Gryffindor — ”
93604	93621	93623	93624	Katie Bell	448	“ You ’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match , Harry ! ”
93632	93645	93579	93579	Angelina	435	“ We ’ve got food , Harry , come and have some — ”
93646	93659	93626	93630	another of the Gryffindor Chasers	2558	“ I ’m not hungry , I had enough at the feast — ”
93800	93805	93806	93806	he	248	“ I did n’t , ”
93814	93823	93806	93806	he	248	“ I do n’t know how it happened . ”
93843	93848	93849	93849	he	248	“ I ’m tired ! ”
93859	93872	93849	93849	he	248	“ No , seriously , George — I ’m going to bed — ”
93982	93988	93989	93989	Harry	248	“ Where ’ve you been ? ”
93992	93996	93998	93998	Ron	196	“ Oh hello , ”
94065	94068	94069	94069	he	196	“ So , ”
94086	94089	94069	94069	he	196	“ Congratulations . ”
94090	94097	94099	94099	Harry	248	“ What d’you mean , congratulations ? ”
94124	94136	94138	94138	Ron	196	“ Well … no one else got across the Age Line , ”
94140	94156	94138	94138	Ron	196	“ Not even Fred and George . What did you use — the Invisibility Cloak ? ”
94157	94170	94172	94172	Harry	248	“ The Invisibility Cloak would n’t have got me over that line , ”
94175	94179	94181	94181	Ron	196	“ Oh right , ”
94183	94219	94181	94181	Ron	196	“ I thought you might ’ve told me if it was the cloak … because it would ’ve covered both of us , would n’t it ? But you found another way , did you ? ”
94220	94223	94225	94225	Harry	248	“ Listen , ”
94227	94245	94225	94225	Harry	248	“ I did n’t put my name in that goblet . Someone else must ’ve done it . ”
94251	94259	94248	94248	his	196	“ What would they do that for ? ”
94260	94264	94266	94266	Harry	248	“ I dunno , ”
94278	94283	94266	94266	Harry	248	“ To kill me . ”
94301	94316	94317	94317	he	196	“ It ’s okay , you know , you can tell me the truth , ”
94320	94404	94317	94317	he	196	“ If you do n’t want everyone else to know , fine , but I do n’t know why you ’re bothering to lie , you did n’t get into trouble for it , did you ? That friend of the Fat Lady ’s , that Violet , she ’s already told us all Dumbledore ’s letting you enter . A thousand Galleons prize money , eh ? And you do n’t have to do end - of - year tests either . … ”
94405	94416	94418	94418	Harry	248	“ I did n’t put my name in that goblet ! ”
94425	94430	94432	94432	Ron	196	“ Yeah , okay , ”
94443	94474	94432	94432	Ron	196	“ Only you said this morning you ’d have done it last night , and no one would ’ve seen you . … I ’m not stupid , you know . ”
94475	94486	94487	94487	Harry	248	“ You ’re doing a really good impression of it , ”
94490	94493	94495	94495	Ron	196	“ Yeah ? ”
94515	94543	94495	94495	Ron	196	“ You want to get to bed , Harry . I expect you ’ll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo - call or something . ”
94793	94796	94797	94797	she	186	“ Hello , ”
94815	94829	94797	94797	she	186	“ I brought you this . … Want to go for a walk ? ”
94830	94834	94836	94836	Harry	248	“ Good idea , ”
94926	94939	94940	94940	she	186	“ Well , of course I knew you had n’t entered yourself , ”
94958	95016	94940	94940	she	186	“ The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name ! But the question is , who did put it in ? Because Moody ’s right , Harry … I do n’t think any student could have done it … they ’d never be able to fool the Goblet , or get over Dumbledore ’s — ”
95017	95023	95024	95024	Harry	248	“ Have you seen Ron ? ”
95030	95040	95041	95041	she	186	“ Erm … yes … he was at breakfast , ”
95044	95053	94940	94940	she	186	“ Does he still think I entered myself ? ”
95054	95068	95070	95070	Hermione	186	“ Well … no , I do n’t think so … not really , ”
95073	95086	94940	94940	she	186	“ What ’s that supposed to mean , ‘ not really ’ ? ”
95087	95096	95097	95097	Hermione	186	“ Oh Harry , is n’t it obvious ? ”
95101	95106	95097	95097	Hermione	186	“ He ’s jealous ! ”
95107	95110	95111	95111	Harry	248	“ Jealous ? ”
95115	95138	95111	95111	Harry	248	“ Jealous of what ? He wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school , does he ? ”
95139	95142	95144	95144	Hermione	186	“ Look , ”
95147	95171	95172	95172	she	186	“ it ’s always you who gets all the attention , you know it is . I know it ’s not your fault , ”
95183	95262	95179	95179	his	248	“ I know you do n’t ask for it … but — well — you know , Ron ’s got all those brothers to compete against at home , and you ’re his best friend , and you ’re really famous — he ’s always shunted to one side whenever people see you , and he puts up with it , and he never mentions it , but I suppose this is just one time too many . … ”
95263	95266	95268	95268	Harry	248	“ Great , ”
95271	95308	95268	95268	Harry	248	“ Really great . Tell him from me I ’ll swap any time he wants . Tell him from me he ’s welcome to it . … People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go . … ”
95309	95317	95318	95318	Hermione	186	“ I ’m not telling him anything , ”
95322	95337	95318	95318	Hermione	186	“ Tell him yourself . It ’s the only way to sort this out . ”
95338	95353	95354	95354	Harry	248	“ I ’m not running around after him trying to make him grow up ! ”
95371	95390	95354	95354	Harry	248	“ Maybe he ’ll believe I ’m not enjoying myself once I ’ve got my neck broken or — ”
95391	95397	95399	95399	Hermione	186	“ That ’s not funny , ”
95402	95410	95411	95411	She	186	“ That ’s not funny at all . ”
95416	95449	95411	95411	She	186	“ Harry , I ’ve been thinking — you know what we ’ve got to do , do n’t you ? Straight away , the moment we get back to the castle ? ”
95450	95461	95354	95354	Harry	248	“ Yeah , give Ron a good kick up the — ”
95462	95518	95411	95411	She	186	“ Write to Sirius . You ’ve got to tell him what ’s happened . He asked you to keep him posted on everything that ’s going on at Hogwarts . … It ’s almost as if he expected something like this to happen . I brought some parchment and a quill out with me — ”
95519	95524	95526	95526	Harry	248	“ Come off it , ”
95546	95581	95526	95526	Harry	248	“ He came back to the country just because my scar twinged . He ’ll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone ’s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament — ”
95582	95591	95593	95593	Hermione	186	“ He ’d want you to tell him , ”
95596	95605	95593	95593	Hermione	186	“ He ’s going to find out anyway — ”
95606	95609	95411	95411	She	186	“ How ? ”
95610	95622	95624	95624	Hermione	186	“ Harry , this is n’t going to be kept quiet , ”
95629	95690	95624	95624	Hermione	186	“ This tournament ’s famous , and you ’re famous . I ’ll be really surprised if there is n’t anything in the Daily Prophet about you competing . … You ’re already in half the books about You - Know - Who , you know … and Sirius would rather hear it from you , I know he would . ”
95691	95702	95704	95704	Harry	248	“ Okay , okay , I ’ll write to him , ”
95751	95760	95761	95761	Harry	248	“ Whose owl am I going to use ? ”
95769	95779	95761	95761	Harry	248	“ He told me not to use Hedwig again . ”
95780	95788	95830	95830	Hermione	186	“ Ask Ron if you can borrow — ”
95789	95798	95799	95799	Harry	248	“ I ’m not asking Ron for anything , ”
95803	95820	95822	95822	Hermione	186	“ Well , borrow one of the school owls , then , anyone can use them , ”
96025	96028	96029	96029	he	248	“ Finished , ”
96060	96067	96068	96068	Harry	248	“ I ca n’t use you , ”
96079	96090	96068	96068	Harry	248	“ I ’ve got to use one of these . … ”
96164	96171	96173	96173	Harry	248	“ First Ron , then you , ”
96176	96183	96173	96173	Harry	248	“ This is n’t my fault . ”
96528	96540	96541	96541	he	290	“ Ah , look , boys , it ’s the champion , ”
96556	96610	96541	96541	he	290	“ Got your autograph books ? Better get a signature now , because I doubt he ’s going to be around much longer . … Half the Triwizard champions have died … how long d’you reckon you ’re going to last , Potter ? Ten minutes into the first task ’s my bet . ”
96717	96725	96726	96726	he	290	“ Take this thing for a walk ? ”
96738	96762	96726	96726	he	290	“ And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash ? Around the sting , the blasting end , or the sucker ? ”
96763	96769	96771	96771	Hagrid	205	“ Roun ’ the middle , ”
96775	96814	96771	96771	Hagrid	205	“ Er — yeh might want ter put on yer dragon - hide gloves , jus ’ as an extra precaution , like . Harry — you come here an ’ help me with this big one . … ”
96857	96873	96835	96835	He	205	“ So — yer competin ’ , Harry . In the tournament . School champion . ”
96874	96880	96881	96881	Harry	162	“ One of the champions , ”
96899	96911	96895	96895	his	205	“ No idea who put yeh in fer it , Harry ? ”
96912	96923	96925	96925	Harry	162	“ You believe I did n’t do it , then ? ”
96941	96947	96948	96948	Hagrid	205	“ ’ Course I do , ”
96951	96975	96948	96948	Hagrid	205	“ Yeh say it wasn ’ you , an ’ I believe yeh — an ’ Dumbledore believes yer , an ’ all . ”
96976	96985	96987	96987	Harry	162	“ Wish I knew who did do it , ”
97078	97090	97091	97091	Hagrid	205	“ Look like they ’re havin’ fun , don ’ they ? ”
97160	97170	97171	97171	Hagrid	205	“ Ah , I don ’ know , Harry , ”
97188	97204	97185	97185	his	205	“ School champion … everythin ’ seems ter happen ter you , doesn ’ it ? ”
97639	97649	97662	97662	she	186	“ It ’s really not that difficult , Harry , ”

97955	97961	97963	97963	Malfoy	290	“ Like them , Potter ? ”
97969	97980	97963	97963	Malfoy	290	“ And this is n’t all they do — look ! ”
98046	98051	98052	98052	Hermione	186	“ Oh very funny , ”
98072	98076	98059	98063	her gang of Slytherin girls	2648	“ really witty . ”
98103	98109	98111	98111	Malfoy	290	“ Want one , Granger ? ”
98120	98153	98111	98111	Malfoy	290	“ I ’ve got loads . But do n’t touch my hand , now . I ’ve just washed it , you see ; do n’t want a Mudblood sliming it up . ”
98206	98209	98210	98210	Hermione	186	“ Harry ! ”
98214	98222	98229	98229	his	290	“ Go on , then , Potter , ”

98279	98282	98283	98283	Harry	162	“ Furnunculus ! ”
98286	98289	98291	98291	Malfoy	290	“ Densaugeo ! ”

98448	98457	98477	98477	Snape	368	“ And what is all this noise about ? ”
98488	98491	98477	98477	Snape	368	“ Explain . ”
98492	98499	98477	98477	Snape	368	“ Potter attacked me , sir — ”
98500	98510	98511	98511	Harry	162	“ We attacked each other at the same time ! ”
98514	98523	98511	98511	Harry	162	“ — and he hit Goyle — look — ”
98546	98552	98553	98553	Snape	368	“ Hospital wing , Goyle , ”
98557	98562	98563	98563	Ron	196	“ Malfoy got Hermione ! ”
98566	98569	98563	98563	Ron	196	“ Look ! ”
98637	98643	98628	98628	Snape	368	“ I see no difference . ”
98734	98739	98740	98740	he	162	“ Let ’s see , ”
98748	98777	98740	98740	he	162	“ Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley . Now get inside , or it ’ll be a week ’s worth of detentions . ”
98943	98946	98948	98948	Snape	368	“ Antidotes ! ”
98963	98996	98948	98948	Snape	368	“ You should all have prepared your recipes now . I want you to brew them carefully , and then , we will be selecting someone on whom to test one . … ”
99088	99091	99093	99093	Snape	368	“ Yes ? ”
99096	99110	99064	99064	he	361	“ Please , sir , I ’m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs . ”
99128	99138	99140	99140	Snape	368	“ Potter has another hour of Potions to complete , ”
99143	99154	99140	99140	Snape	368	“ He will come upstairs when this class is finished . ”
99159	99169	99170	99170	he	361	“ Sir — sir , Mr. Bagman wants him , ”
99174	99192	99170	99170	he	361	“ All the champions have got to go , I think they want to take photographs . … ”
99227	99234	99235	99235	Snape	368	“ Very well , very well , ”
99238	99258	99235	99235	Snape	368	“ Potter , leave your things here , I want you back down here later to test your antidote . ”
99259	99274	99276	99276	Colin	361	“ Please , sir — he ’s got to take his things with him , ”
99278	99283	99276	99276	Colin	361	“ All the champions — ”
99284	99288	99290	99290	Snape	368	“ Very well ! ”
99292	99305	99290	99290	Snape	368	“ Potter — take your bag and get out of my sight ! ”
99340	99351	99353	99353	Colin	361	“ It ’s amazing , is n’t it , Harry ? ”
99369	99380	99360	99360	Harry	162	“ Is n’t it , though ? You being champion ? ”
99381	99387	99389	99389	Harry	162	“ Yeah , really amazing , ”
99403	99413	99389	99389	Harry	162	“ What do they want photos for , Colin ? ”
99414	99422	99360	99360	Harry	162	“ The Daily Prophet , I think ! ”
99423	99426	99428	99428	Harry	162	“ Great , ”
99431	99440	99428	99428	Harry	162	“ Exactly what I need . More publicity . ”
99441	99445	99447	99447	Colin	361	“ Good luck ! ”
99652	99698	99639	99639	Bagman	230	“ Ah , here he is ! Champion number four ! In you come , Harry , in you come … nothing to worry about , it ’s just the wand weighing ceremony , the rest of the judges will be here in a moment — ”
99699	99703	99704	99704	Harry	162	“ Wand weighing ? ”
99708	99738	99740	99740	Bagman	230	“ We have to check that your wands are fully functional , no problems , you know , as they ’re your most important tools in the tasks ahead , ”
99742	99768	99769	99769	he	230	“ The expert ’s upstairs now with Dumbledore . And then there ’s going to be a little photo shoot . This is Rita Skeeter , ”
99780	99796	99769	99769	he	230	“ She ’s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily Prophet . … ”
99797	99805	99810	99810	her	333	“ Maybe not that small , Ludo , ”
99859	99875	99876	99876	she	333	“ I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start ? ”
99888	99903	99876	99876	she	333	“ The youngest champion , you know … to add a bit of color ? ”
99904	99907	99909	99909	Bagman	230	“ Certainly ! ”
99911	99921	99909	99909	Bagman	230	“ That is — if Harry has no objection ? ”
99922	99925	99927	99927	Harry	162	“ Er — ”
99929	99932	99934	99935	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Lovely , ”
99974	99988	99989	99989	she	333	“ We do n’t want to be in there with all that noise , ”
99992	100007	99989	99989	she	333	“ Let ’s see … ah , yes , this is nice and cozy . ”
100019	100031	100038	100038	herself	333	“ Come along , dear — that ’s right — lovely , ”
100063	100069	100038	100038	herself	333	“ Let ’s see now … ”
100109	100137	100086	100086	she	333	“ You wo n’t mind , Harry , if I use a Quick - Quotes Quill ? It leaves me free to talk to you normally . … ”
100138	100142	100144	100144	Harry	162	“ A what ? ”
100240	100253	100200	100200	She	333	“ Testing … my name is Rita Skeeter , Daily Prophet reporter . ”
100300	100303	100305	100306	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Lovely , ”
100340	100355	100333	100333	she	333	“ So , Harry … what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament ? ”
100356	100359	100361	100361	Harry	162	“ Er — ”
100420	100427	100429	100430	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Ignore the quill , Harry , ”
100442	100456	100435	100435	Harry	162	“ Now — why did you decide to enter the tournament , Harry ? ”
100457	100462	100464	100464	Harry	162	“ I did n’t , ”
100466	100489	100464	100464	Harry	162	“ I do n’t know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire . I did n’t put it in there . ”
100498	100541	100490	100491	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Come now , Harry , there ’s no need to be scared of getting into trouble . We all know you should n’t really have entered at all . But do n’t worry about that . Our readers love a rebel . ”
100542	100549	100550	100550	Harry	162	“ But I did n’t enter , ”
100553	100560	100550	100550	Harry	162	“ I do n’t know who — ”
100561	100571	100573	100574	Rita Skeeter	333	“ How do you feel about the tasks ahead ? ”
100576	100581	100573	100574	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Excited ? Nervous ? ”
100582	100596	100598	100598	Harry	162	“ I have n’t really thought … yeah , nervous , I suppose , ”
100608	100620	100622	100623	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Champions have died in the past , have n’t they ? ”
100626	100635	100622	100623	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Have you thought about that at all ? ”
100636	100652	100654	100654	Harry	162	“ Well … they say it ’s going to be a lot safer this year , ”
100674	100691	100693	100694	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Of course , you ’ve looked death in the face before , have n’t you ? ”
100700	100710	100693	100694	Rita Skeeter	333	“ How would you say that ’s affected you ? ”
100711	100714	100716	100716	Harry	162	“ Er , ”
100721	100762	100693	100694	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself ? To live up to your name ? Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because — ”
100763	100769	100771	100771	Harry	162	“ I did n’t enter , ”
100778	100787	100789	100790	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Can you remember your parents at all ? ”
100796	100799	100801	100801	Harry	162	“ No , ”
100803	100828	100789	100790	Rita Skeeter	333	“ How do you think they ’d feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard Tournament ? Proud ? Worried ? Angry ? ”
100898	100908	100910	100910	Harry	162	“ I have NOT got tears in my eyes ! ”
100958	100961	100963	100964	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Dumbledore ! ”
101010	101015	101016	101016	she	333	“ How are you ? ”
101034	101053	101016	101016	she	333	“ I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards ’ Conference ? ”
101054	101058	101060	101060	Dumbledore	195	“ Enchantingly nasty , ”
101066	101079	101062	101062	his	195	“ I particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat . ”
101088	101117	101080	101081	Rita Skeeter	333	“ I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old - fashioned , Dumbledore , and that many wizards in the street — ”
101118	101133	101135	101135	Dumbledore	195	“ I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness , Rita , ”
101145	101187	101135	101135	Dumbledore	195	“ but I ’m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later . The Weighing of the Wands is about to start , and it can not take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard . ”
101303	101310	101315	101315	his	195	“ May I introduce Mr. Ollivander ? ”
101328	101347	101315	101315	his	195	“ He will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament . ”
101402	101414	101416	101417	Mr. Ollivander	457	“ Mademoiselle Delacour , could we have you first , please ? ”
101444	101447	101448	101448	he	457	“ Hmmm … ”
101486	101489	101490	101490	he	457	“ Yes , ”
101494	101511	101490	101490	he	457	“ nine and a half inches … inflexible … rosewood … and containing … dear me … ”
101512	101524	101526	101526	Fleur	439	“ An ’ air from ze ’ ead of a veela , ”
101528	101535	101526	101526	Fleur	439	“ One of my grandmuzzer ’s . ”
101564	101567	101569	101570	Mr. Ollivander	457	“ Yes , ”
101572	101608	101569	101570	Mr. Ollivander	457	“ yes , I ’ve never used veela hair myself , of course . I find it makes for rather temperamental wands … however , to each his own , and if this suits you … ”
101629	101632	101626	101626	he	457	“ Orchideous ! ”
101644	101658	101660	101661	Mr. Ollivander	457	“ Very well , very well , it ’s in fine working order , ”
101676	101683	101671	101671	Fleur	439	“ Mr. Diggory , you next . ”
101699	101714	101716	101717	Mr. Ollivander	457	“ Ah , now , this is one of mine , is n’t it ? ”
101731	101794	101725	101725	Cedric	247	“ Yes , I remember it well . Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn … must have been seventeen hands ; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail . Twelve and a quarter inches … ash … pleasantly springy . It ’s in fine condition . … You treat it regularly ? ”
101795	101801	101803	101803	Cedric	247	“ Polished it last night , ”
101893	101901	101886	101886	himself	457	“ Mr. Krum , if you please . ”
101940	101943	101945	101946	Mr. Ollivander	457	“ Hmm , ”
101948	101978	101945	101946	Mr. Ollivander	457	“ this is a Gregorovitch creation , unless I ’m much mistaken ? A fine wand - maker , though the styling is never quite what I … however … ”
101997	102005	102006	102006	he	457	“ Yes … hornbeam and dragon heartstring ? ”
102014	102033	102006	102006	he	457	“ Rather thicker than one usually sees … quite rigid … ten and a quarter inches … Avis ! ”
102068	102071	102073	102074	Mr. Ollivander	457	“ Good , ”
102082	102089	102073	102074	Mr. Ollivander	457	“ Which leaves … Mr. Potter . ”
102109	102114	102116	102117	Mr. Ollivander	457	“ Aaaah , yes , ”
102125	102137	102119	102119	his	457	“ Yes , yes , yes . How well I remember . ”
102258	102261	102262	102262	he	162	“ Curious , ”
102266	102269	102262	102262	he	162	“ curious , ”
102441	102446	102448	102448	Dumbledore	195	“ Thank you all , ”
102458	102488	102448	102448	Dumbledore	195	“ You may go back to your lessons now — or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner , as they are about to end — ”
102519	102526	102528	102528	Bagman	230	“ Photos , Dumbledore , photos ! ”
102531	102545	102528	102528	Bagman	230	“ All the judges and champions , what do you think , Rita ? ”
102546	102557	102559	102560	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Er — yes , let ’s do those first , ”
102569	102577	102559	102560	Rita Skeeter	333	“ And then perhaps some individual shots . ”
102779	102786	102788	102788	Ron	196	“ You ’ve had an owl , ”
102814	102819	102821	102821	Harry	162	“ Oh — right , ”
102823	102839	102841	102841	Ron	196	“ And we ’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night , Snape ’s dungeon , ”
103622	103625	103632	103632	She	333	“ er ’s ”
103725	103740	103707	103707	people	5092	“ Want a hanky , Potter , in case you start crying in Transfiguration ? ”
103741	103771	103707	103707	people	5092	“ Since when have you been one of the top students in the school , Potter ? Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together ? ”
103772	103777	103707	103707	people	5092	“ Hey — Harry ! ”
103778	103785	103786	103786	Harry	162	“ Yeah , that ’s right ! ”
103804	103830	103788	103788	himself	162	“ I ’ve just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum , and I ’m just off to do a bit more . … ”
103831	103843	103786	103786	Harry	162	“ No — it was just — you dropped your quill . ”
103857	103864	103865	103865	he	162	“ Oh — right — sorry , ”
103873	103881	103882	103882	she	2730	“ Er … good luck on Tuesday , ”
103885	103893	103882	103882	she	2730	“ I really hope you do well . ”
103940	103946	103947	103948	Pansy Parkinson	453	“ Stunningly pretty ? Her ? ”
103971	103981	103954	103954	she	453	“ What was she judging against — a chipmunk ? ”
103982	103986	103987	103987	Hermione	186	“ Ignore it , ”
104015	104022	104009	104009	she	186	“ Just ignore it , Harry . ”
104165	104172	104173	104173	Harry	162	“ I did n’t start this , ”
104177	104183	104173	104173	Harry	162	“ It ’s his problem . ”
104184	104189	104190	104190	Hermione	186	“ You miss him ! ”
104194	104202	104190	104190	Hermione	186	“ And I know he misses you — ”
104203	104207	104209	104209	Harry	162	“ Miss him ? ”
104211	104219	104209	104209	Harry	162	“ I do n’t miss him . … ”
104385	104394	104395	104395	she	186	“ He ’s not even good - looking ! ”
104406	104434	104395	104395	she	186	“ They only like him because he ’s famous ! They would n’t look twice at him if he could n’t do that Wonky - Faint thing — ”
104435	104439	104441	104441	Harry	162	“ Wronski Feint , ”
104611	104618	104619	104619	he	162	“ What about Ron , though ? ”
104622	104632	104619	104619	he	162	“ Do n’t you want to go with him ? ”
104633	104638	104639	104639	Hermione	186	“ Oh … well … ”
104644	104659	104639	104639	Hermione	186	“ I thought we might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks . … ”
104660	104663	104665	104665	Harry	162	“ No , ”
104668	104677	104639	104639	Hermione	186	“ Oh Harry , this is so stupid — ”
104678	104698	104639	104639	Hermione	186	“ I ’ll come , but I ’m not meeting Ron , and I ’m wearing my Invisibility Cloak . ”
104699	104705	104706	104706	Hermione	186	“ Oh all right then … ”
104709	104732	104706	104706	Hermione	186	“ but I hate talking to you in that cloak , I never know if I ’m looking at you or not . ”
104808	104816	104818	104818	Hermione	186	“ People keep looking at me now , ”
104836	104845	104818	104818	Hermione	186	“ They think I ’m talking to myself . ”
104846	104856	104818	104818	Hermione	186	“ Do n’t move your lips so much then . ”
104857	104880	104818	104818	Hermione	186	“ Come on , please just take off your cloak for a bit , no one ’s going to bother you here . ”
104881	104885	104887	104887	Harry	162	“ Oh yeah ? ”
104889	104894	104887	104887	Harry	162	“ Look behind you . ”
104954	104973	104951	104951	Harry	162	“ She ’s staying in the village . I bet she ’s coming to watch the first task . ”
105023	105028	105030	105030	Hermione	186	“ She ’s gone , ”
105043	105077	105078	105078	she	186	“ Why do n’t we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks , it ’s a bit cold , is n’t it ? You do n’t have to talk to Ron ! ”
105266	105280	105281	105281	she	186	“ I look like such an idiot , sitting here on my own , ”
105284	105292	105281	105281	she	186	“ Lucky I brought something to do . ”
105355	105373	105374	105374	Hermione	186	“ You know , maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in S.P.E.W. , ”
105383	105388	105390	105390	Harry	162	“ Yeah , right , ”
105402	105417	105392	105392	He	162	“ Hermione , when are you going to give up on this spew stuff ? ”
105418	105430	105431	105431	she	186	“ When house - elves have decent wages and working conditions ! ”
105435	105462	105431	105431	she	186	“ You know , I ’m starting to think it ’s time for more direct action . I wonder how you get into the school kitchens ? ”
105463	105472	105474	105474	Harry	162	“ No idea , ask Fred and George , ”
105817	105824	105826	105826	Hermione	186	“ Look , it ’s Hagrid ! ”
106081	106087	106089	106089	Hagrid	205	“ All right , Hermione ? ”
106092	106095	106097	106097	Hermione	186	“ Hello , ”
106124	106130	106121	106121	he	394	“ Nice cloak , Potter . ”
106159	106171	106156	106156	Moody	394	“ Can your eye — I mean , can you — ? ”
106172	106182	106183	106183	Moody	394	“ Yeah , it can see through Invisibility Cloaks , ”
106187	106202	106183	106183	Moody	394	“ And it ’s come in useful at times , I can tell you . ”
106258	106274	106229	106229	Hagrid	205	“ Harry , meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin . Wear that cloak . ”
106282	106290	106278	106278	Hagrid	205	“ Nice ter see yeh , Hermione , ”
106300	106312	106313	106313	Harry	162	“ Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight ? ”
106319	106323	106325	106325	Hermione	186	“ Does he ? ”
106330	106351	106352	106352	She	186	“ I wonder what he ’s up to ? I do n’t know whether you should go , Harry . … ”
106359	106368	106352	106352	She	186	“ It might make you late for Sirius . ”
106604	106607	106597	106597	He	162	“ Thanks ! ”
106664	106670	106671	106671	Hagrid	205	“ You there , Harry ? ”
106681	106684	106686	106686	Harry	162	“ Yeah , ”
106701	106706	106686	106686	Harry	162	“ What ’s up ? ”
106707	106714	106716	106716	Hagrid	205	“ Got summat ter show yeh , ”
106777	106784	106785	106785	Harry	162	“ What ’re you showing me ? ”
106816	106833	106835	106835	Hagrid	205	“ Come with me , keep quiet , an ’ keep yerself covered with that cloak , ”
106837	106851	106835	106835	Hagrid	205	“ We won ’ take Fang , he won ’ like it . … ”
106852	106878	106885	106885	he	205	“ Listen , Hagrid , I ca n’t stay long . … I ’ve got to be back up at the castle by one o’clock — ”
106920	106926	106911	106911	Hagrid	205	“ Hagrid , what — ? ”
106927	106930	106932	106932	Hagrid	205	“ Shhh ! ”
106972	106982	106968	106968	she	322	“ Ah , ’ Agrid … it is time ? ”
106983	106988	106990	106990	Hagrid	205	“ Bong - sewer , ”
107105	107117	107101	107101	she	322	“ Wair is it you are taking me , ’ Agrid ? ”
107118	107123	107125	107125	Hagrid	205	“ Yeh’ll enjoy this , ”
107128	107156	107125	107125	Hagrid	205	“ worth seein ’ , trust me . On’y — don ’ go tellin ’ anyone I showed yeh , right ? Yeh’re not s’posed ter know . ”
107157	107162	107164	107165	Madame Maxime	322	“ Of course not , ”
107574	107581	107583	107587	a wizard near the fence	2825	“ Keep back there , Hagrid ! ”
107597	107620	107583	107587	a wizard near the fence	2825	“ They can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet , you know ! I ’ve seen this Horntail do forty ! ”
107621	107627	107629	107629	Hagrid	205	“ Is’n ’ it beautiful ? ”
107632	107638	107640	107641	another wizard	4985	“ It ’s no good ! ”
107643	107653	107640	107641	another wizard	4985	“ Stunning Spells , on the count of three ! ”
107666	107669	107670	107670	they	2827	“ Stupefy ! ”
107819	107826	107827	107827	Hagrid	205	“ Wan ’ a closer look ? ”
107871	107877	107878	107878	he	162	“ All right , Hagrid ? ”
107886	107939	107878	107878	he	162	“ They should be okay now — we put them out with a Sleeping Draft on the way here , thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet — but , like you saw , they were n’t happy , not happy at all — ”
107940	107949	107951	107951	Hagrid	205	“ What breeds you got here , Charlie ? ”
107990	107997	107999	107999	Charlie	220	“ This is a Hungarian Horntail , ”
108001	108036	107999	107999	Charlie	220	“ There ’s a Common Welsh Green over there , the smaller one — a Swedish Short - Snout , that blue - gray — and a Chinese Fireball , that ’s the red . ”
108059	108071	108072	108072	Charlie	220	“ I did n’t know you were bringing her , Hagrid , ”
108077	108101	108072	108072	Charlie	220	“ The champions are n’t supposed to know what ’s coming — she ’s bound to tell her student , is n’t she ? ”
108102	108113	108115	108115	Hagrid	205	“ Jus ’ thought she ’d like ter see ’em , ”
108126	108133	108135	108135	Charlie	220	“ Really romantic date , Hagrid , ”
108141	108144	108146	108146	Hagrid	205	“ Four … ”
108148	108173	108146	108146	Hagrid	205	“ so it ’s one fer each o ’ the champions , is it ? What ’ve they got ta do — fight ’em ? ”
108174	108183	108185	108185	Charlie	220	“ Just get past them , I think , ”
108187	108247	108185	108185	Charlie	220	“ We ’ll be on hand if it gets nasty , Extinguishing Spells at the ready . They wanted nesting mothers , I do n’t know why … but I tell you this , I do n’t envy the one who gets the Horntail . Vicious thing . Its back end ’s as dangerous as its front , look . ”
108320	108329	108331	108331	Charlie	220	“ I ’ve got them counted , Hagrid , ”
108338	108343	108335	108335	he	220	“ How ’s Harry ? ”
108344	108347	108349	108349	Hagrid	205	“ Fine , ”
108359	108373	108375	108375	Charlie	220	“ Just hope he ’s still fine after he ’s faced this lot , ”
108386	108413	108414	108414	Charlie	220	“ I did n’t dare tell Mum what he ’s got to do for the first task ; she ’s already having kittens about him . … ”
108422	108487	108414	108414	Charlie	220	“ ‘ How could they let him enter that tournament , he ’s much too young ! I thought they were all safe , I thought there was going to be an age limit ! ’ She was in floods after that Daily Prophet article about him . ‘ He still cries about his parents ! Oh bless him , I never knew ! ’ ”
108733	108740	108775	108775	Karkaroff	430	“ Ouch ! Who ’s there ? ”
108777	108782	108784	108784	Karkaroff	430	“ Who ’s there ? ”
109052	109055	109056	109056	he	162	“ Balderdash ! ”
109076	109082	109083	109083	she	2851	“ If you say so , ”
109283	109291	109267	109267	he	162	“ Sirius — how ’re you doing ? ”
109372	109381	109383	109383	Sirius	202	“ Never mind me , how are you ? ”
109386	109390	109416	109416	he	162	“ I ’m — ”
109399	109401	109395	109395	Harry	162	“ fine ”
109482	109512	109513	109513	he	162	“ … and now Hagrid ’s just shown me what ’s coming in the first task , and it ’s dragons , Sirius , and I ’m a goner , ”
109563	109620	109560	109560	he	162	“ Dragons we can deal with , Harry , but we ’ll get to that in a minute — I have n’t got long here … I ’ve broken into a wizarding house to use the fire , but they could be back at any time . There are things I need to warn you about . ”
109621	109624	109626	109626	Harry	162	“ What ? ”
109648	109651	109653	109653	Sirius	202	“ Karkaroff , ”
109655	109675	109653	109653	Sirius	202	“ Harry , he was a Death Eater . You know what Death Eaters are , do n’t you ? ”
109676	109683	109560	109560	he	162	“ Yes — he — what ? ”
109684	109737	109653	109653	Sirius	202	“ He was caught , he was in Azkaban with me , but he got released . I ’d bet everything that ’s why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year — to keep an eye on him . Moody caught Karkaroff . Put him into Azkaban in the first place . ”
109738	109743	109744	109744	Harry	162	“ Karkaroff got released ? ”
109763	109770	109744	109744	Harry	162	“ Why did they release him ? ”
109771	109782	109784	109784	Sirius	202	“ He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic , ”
109787	109872	109784	109784	Sirius	202	“ He said he ’d seen the error of his ways , and then he named names … he put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place . … He ’s not very popular in there , I can tell you . And since he got out , from what I can tell , he ’s been teaching the Dark Arts to every student who passes through that school of his . So watch out for the Durmstrang champion as well . ”
109873	109876	109878	109878	Harry	162	“ Okay , ”
109881	109921	109878	109878	Harry	162	“ But … are you saying Karkaroff put my name in the goblet ? Because if he did , he ’s a really good actor . He seemed furious about it . He wanted to stop me from competing . ”
109922	109931	109933	109933	Sirius	202	“ We know he ’s a good actor , ”
109935	109967	109933	109933	Sirius	202	“ because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free , did n’t he ? Now , I ’ve been keeping an eye on the Daily Prophet , Harry — ”
109968	109978	109980	109980	Harry	162	“ — you and the rest of the world , ”
109983	110022	110023	110023	Sirius	202	“ — and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman ’s article last month , Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts . Yes , I know she says it was another false alarm , ”
110033	110118	110023	110023	Sirius	202	“ but I do n’t think so , somehow . I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts . I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around . And no one ’s going to look into it too closely ; Mad - Eye ’s heard intruders a bit too often . But that does n’t mean he ca n’t still spot the real thing . Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had . ”
110119	110127	110129	110129	Harry	162	“ So … what are you saying ? ”
110132	110144	110129	110129	Harry	162	“ Karkaroff ’s trying to kill me ? But — why ? ”
110148	110158	110159	110159	he	202	“ I ’ve been hearing some very strange things , ”
110163	110215	110159	110159	he	202	“ The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately . They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup , did n’t they ? Someone set off the Dark Mark … and then — did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who ’s gone missing ? ”
110216	110220	110222	110222	Harry	162	“ Bertha Jorkins ? ”
110224	110260	110159	110159	he	202	“ Exactly … she disappeared in Albania , and that ’s definitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last … and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up , would n’t she ? ”
110261	110282	110284	110284	Harry	162	“ Yeah , but … it ’s not very likely she ’d have walked straight into Voldemort , is it ? ”
110286	110294	110296	110296	Sirius	202	“ Listen , I knew Bertha Jorkins , ”
110299	110356	110296	110296	Sirius	202	“ She was at Hogwarts when I was , a few years above your dad and me . And she was an idiot . Very nosy , but no brains , none at all . It ’s not a good combination , Harry . I ’d say she ’d be very easy to lure into a trap .
110357	110370	110372	110372	Harry	162	“ So … so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament ? ”
110374	110391	110372	110372	Harry	162	“ Is that what you mean ? You think Karkaroff might be here on his orders ? ”
110392	110398	110400	110400	Sirius	202	“ I do n’t know , ”
110403	110474	110400	110400	Sirius	202	“ I just do n’t know … Karkaroff does n’t strike me as the type who ’d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him . But whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason , and I ca n’t help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it look like an accident . ”
110475	110488	110490	110490	Harry	162	“ Looks like a really good plan from where I ’m standing , ”
110494	110510	110490	110490	Harry	162	“ They ’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff . ”
110511	110517	110519	110519	Sirius	202	“ Right — these dragons , ”
110526	110575	110519	110519	Sirius	202	“ There ’s a way , Harry . Do n’t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell — dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner , you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon — ”
110576	110586	110588	110588	Harry	162	“ Yeah , I know , I just saw , ”
110590	110598	110600	110600	Sirius	202	“ But you can do it alone , ”
110602	110619	110600	110600	Sirius	202	“ There is a way , and a simple spell ’s all you need . Just — ”
110652	110655	110656	110656	he	162	“ Go ! ”
110661	110669	110656	110656	he	162	“ Go ! There ’s someone coming ! ”
110796	110803	110804	110804	he	196	“ Who were you talking to ? ”
110807	110817	110818	110818	Harry	162	“ What ’s that got to do with you ? ”
110821	110834	110818	110818	Harry	162	“ What are you doing down here at this time of night ? ”
110835	110842	110843	110843	Ron	196	“ I just wondered where you — ”
110849	110859	110843	110843	Ron	196	“ Nothing . I ’m going back to bed . ”
110860	110872	110873	110873	Harry	162	“ Just thought you ’d come nosing around , did you ? ”
110929	110934	110936	110936	Ron	196	“ Sorry about that , ”
110944	110971	110936	110936	Ron	196	“ Should ’ve realized you did n’t want to be disturbed . I ’ll let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace . ”
111008	111013	111014	111014	Harry	162	“ There you go , ”
111017	111050	111014	111014	Harry	162	“ Something for you to wear on Tuesday . You might even have a scar now , if you ’re lucky . … That ’s what you want , is n’t it ? ”
111276	111289	111290	111290	she	186	“ Let ’s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening , ”
111294	111303	111290	111290	she	186	“ and then we can worry about Karkaroff . ”
111368	111401	111468	111468	He	162	“ ‘ Talon - clipping by charms … treating scale - rot … ’ This is no good , this is for nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy . … ”
111402	111444	111468	111468	He	162	“ ‘ Dragons are extremely difficult to slay , owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides , which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate … ’ But Sirius said a simple one would do it . … ”
111445	111455	111457	111457	Harry	162	“ Let ’s try some simple spellbooks , then , ”
111499	111635	111468	111468	He	162	“ Well , there are Switching Spells … but what ’s the point of Switching it ? Unless you swapped its fangs for wine - gums or something that would make it less dangerous . … The trouble is , like that book said , not much is going to get through a dragon ’s hide . … I ’d say Transfigure it , but something that big , you really have n’t got a hope , I doubt even Professor McGonagall … unless you ’re supposed to put the spell on yourself ? Maybe to give yourself extra powers ? But they ’re not simple spells , I mean , we have n’t done any of those in class , I only know about them because I ’ve been doing O.W.L. practice papers . … ”
111636	111639	111640	111640	Harry	162	“ Hermione , ”
111647	111664	111640	111640	Harry	162	“ will you shut up for a bit , please ? I ’m trying to concentrate . ”
111749	111768	111770	111770	Hermione	186	“ Oh no , he ’s back again , why ca n’t he read on his stupid ship ? ”
111802	111830	111791	111791	himself	234	“ Come on , Harry , we ’ll go back to the common room … his fan club’ll be here in a moment , twittering away . … ”
112050	112061	112062	112062	Harry	162	“ Hermione , I ’ll see you in the greenhouses , ”
112077	112087	112062	112062	Harry	162	“ Go on , I ’ll catch you up . ”
112088	112103	112062	112062	Harry	162	“ Harry , you ’ll be late , the bell ’s about to ring — ”
112104	112113	112062	112062	Harry	162	“ I ’ll catch you up , okay ? ”
112218	112221	112207	112207	he	247	“ Diffindo ! ”

112371	112378	112369	112369	Harry	162	“ the first task is dragons . ”
112379	112382	112384	112384	Cedric	247	“ What ? ”
112389	112392	112394	112394	Harry	162	“ Dragons , ”
112413	112434	112401	112402	Professor Flitwick	365	“ They ’ve got four , one for each of us , and we ’ve got to get past them . ”
112460	112465	112466	112466	Cedric	247	“ Are you sure ? ”
112473	112477	112479	112479	Harry	162	“ Dead sure , ”
112481	112487	112479	112479	Harry	162	“ I ’ve seen them . ”
112488	112504	112514	112514	he	162	“ But how did you find out ? We ’re not supposed to know . … ”
112505	112509	112511	112511	Harry	162	“ Never mind , ”
112527	112555	112511	112511	Harry	162	“ But I ’m not the only one who knows . Fleur and Krum will know by now — Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too . ”
112598	112605	112606	112606	he	247	“ Why are you telling me ? ”
112653	112664	112665	112665	he	162	“ It ’s just … fair , is n’t it ? ”
112670	112687	112665	112665	he	162	“ We all know now … we ’re on an even footing , are n’t we ? ”
112724	112731	112732	112732	he	344	“ Come with me , Potter , ”
112735	112742	112732	112732	he	344	“ Diggory , off you go . ”
112754	112767	112750	112750	he	344	“ Er — Professor , I ’m supposed to be in Herbology — ”
112768	112782	112785	112785	him	344	“ Never mind that , Potter . In my office , please . … ”
112901	112914	112915	112915	Moody	344	“ That was a very decent thing you just did , Potter , ”
112938	112942	112944	112944	Moody	344	“ Sit down , ”
113152	113161	113163	113163	Moody	344	“ Like my Dark Detectors , do you ? ”
113171	113176	113177	113177	Harry	162	“ What ’s that ? ”
113187	113272	113273	113273	he	344	“ Secrecy Sensor . Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies … no use here , of course , too much interference — students in every direction lying about why they have n’t done their homework . Been humming ever since I got here . I had to disable my Sneakoscope because it would n’t stop whistling . It ’s extra - sensitive , picks up stuff about a mile around . Of course , it could be picking up more than kid stuff , ”
113279	113287	113273	113273	he	344	“ And what ’s the mirror for ? ”
113288	113328	113329	113329	He	344	“ Oh that ’s my Foe - Glass . See them out there , skulking around ? I ’m not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes . That ’s when I open my trunk . ”
113375	113387	113364	113364	Moody	344	“ So … found out about the dragons , have you ? ”
113422	113428	113430	113430	Moody	344	“ It ’s all right , ”
113444	113461	113430	113430	Moody	344	“ Cheating ’s a traditional part of the Tri - wizard Tournament and always has been . ”
113462	113468	113470	113470	Harry	162	“ I did n’t cheat , ”
113473	113486	113470	113470	Harry	162	“ It was — a sort of accident that I found out . ”
113490	113562	113487	113487	Moody	344	“ I was n’t accusing you , laddie . I ’ve been telling Dumbledore from the start , he can be as high - minded as he likes , but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime wo n’t be . They ’ll have told their champions everything they can . They want to win . They want to beat Dumbledore . They ’d like to prove he ’s only human . ”
113586	113603	113605	113605	Moody	344	“ So … got any ideas how you ’re going to get past your dragon yet ? ”
113607	113610	113612	113612	Harry	162	“ No , ”
113614	113625	113627	113627	Moody	344	“ Well , I ’m not going to tell you , ”
113630	113663	113627	113627	Moody	344	“ I do n’t show favoritism , me . I ’m just going to give you some good , general advice . And the first bit is — play to your strengths . ”
113664	113671	113673	113673	Harry	162	“ I have n’t got any , ”
113681	113685	113687	113687	Moody	344	“ Excuse me , ”
113689	113711	113687	113687	Moody	344	“ you ’ve got strengths if I say you ’ve got them . Think now . What are you best at ? ”
113731	113734	113735	113735	he	162	“ Quidditch , ”
113739	113747	113735	113735	he	162	“ and a fat lot of help — ”
113748	113753	113755	113755	Moody	344	“ That ’s right , ”
113771	113784	113755	113755	Moody	344	“ You ’re a damn good flier from what I ’ve heard . ”
113785	113790	113791	113791	Harry	162	“ Yeah , but … ”
113796	113811	113791	113791	Harry	162	“ I ’m not allowed a broom , I ’ve only got my wand — ”
113812	113820	113822	113822	Moody	344	“ My second piece of general advice , ”
113828	113847	113822	113822	Moody	344	“ is to use a nice , simple spell that will enable you to get what you need . ”
113859	113865	113867	113867	Moody	344	“ Come on , boy … ”
113869	113881	113867	113867	Moody	344	“ Put them together … it ’s not that difficult . … ”
113918	113921	113922	113922	Harry	162	“ Hermione , ”
113947	113957	113922	113922	Harry	162	“ Hermione — I need you to help me . ”
113958	113971	113972	113972	she	366	“ What d’you think I ’ve been trying to do , Harry ? ”
113993	114011	113972	113972	she	366	“ Hermione , I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon . ”
114073	114081	114138	114138	Arithmancy	468	“ Concentrate , Harry , concentrate . … ”
114082	114092	114094	114094	Harry	162	“ What d’you think I ’m trying to do ? ”
114097	114119	114094	114094	Harry	162	“ A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason . … Okay , try again . … ”
114197	114204	114206	114206	Harry	162	“ Well , that ’s good , ”
114217	114236	114206	114206	Harry	162	“ just as long as it ’s not drawn - out . I do n’t want to suffer . ”
114476	114488	114489	114489	Hermione	186	“ That ’s better , Harry , that ’s loads better , ”
114498	114516	114517	114517	Harry	162	“ Well , now we know what to do next time I ca n’t manage a spell , ”
114534	114543	114544	114544	He	162	“ threaten me with a dragon . Right … ”
114551	114555	114544	114544	He	162	“ Accio Dictionary ! ”
114576	114587	114589	114589	Hermione	186	“ Harry , I really think you ’ve got it ! ”
114592	114601	114602	114602	Harry	162	“ Just as long as it works tomorrow , ”
114605	114643	114602	114602	Harry	162	“ The Firebolt ’s going to be much farther away than the stuff in here , it ’s going to be in the castle , and I ’m going to be out there on the grounds . … ”
114644	114650	114652	114652	Hermione	186	“ That does n’t matter , ”
114654	114689	114652	114652	Hermione	186	“ Just as long as you ’re concentrating really , really hard on it , it ’ll come . Harry , we ’d better get some sleep … you ’re going to need it . ”
114793	114804	114785	114785	they	1956	“ We ’ll have a box of tissues ready , Potter ”
114930	114955	114924	114926	Lots of people	2929	“ Potter , the champions have to come down onto the grounds now . … You have to get ready for your first task . ”
114956	114959	114961	114961	Harry	162	“ Okay , ”

114986	114992	114983	114983	Hermione	186	“ You ’ll be fine ! ”
114993	114996	114998	114998	Harry	162	“ Yeah , ”
115060	115067	115068	115068	she	186	“ Now , do n’t panic , ”

Now , I ’m going to have to leave you in a moment , because I ’m commentating . Mr. Diggory , you ’re first , just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle , all right ? Now … Harry … could I have a quick word ? Outside ? ”

116474	116479	116480	116480	Bagman	230	“ Very good indeed ! ”
116484	116493	116480	116480	Bagman	230	“ And now the marks from the judges ! ”

118842	118846	118831	118831	he	162	“ Forget it . ”
118847	118850	118852	118852	Ron	196	“ No , ”
118854	118860	118852	118852	Ron	196	“ I should n’t ’ve — ”
118861	118865	118866	118866	Harry	162	“ Forget it , ”
118885	118893	118894	118894	Harry	162	“ There ’s nothing to cry about ! ”
118900	118907	118908	118908	she	186	“ You two are so stupid ! ”
118950	118954	118956	118956	Ron	196	“ Barking mad , ”
118962	118977	118956	118956	Ron	196	“ Harry , c’m on , they ’ll be putting up your scores . … ”
119015	119261	119007	119007	Ron	196	“ You were the best , you know , no competition . Cedric did this weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground … turned it into a dog … he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him . Well , it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration , and it sort of worked , because he did get the egg , but he got burned as well — the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the Labrador ; he only just got away . And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm , I think she was trying to put it into a trance — well , that kind of worked too , it went all sleepy , but then it snored , and this great jet of flame shot out , and her skirt caught fire — she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand . And Krum — you wo n’t believe this , but he did n’t even think of flying ! He was probably the best after you , though . Hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye . Only thing is , it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs — they took marks off for that , he was n’t supposed to do any damage to them . ”
119308	119319	119320	119320	Ron	196	“ It ’s marks out of ten from each one , ”
119367	119371	119373	119373	Ron	196	“ Not bad ! ”
119379	119391	119373	119373	Ron	196	“ I suppose she took marks off for your shoulder . … ”
119406	119410	119411	119411	Ron	196	“ Looking good ! ”
119444	119447	119449	119449	Harry	248	“ Ten ? ”
119453	119467	119449	119449	Harry	248	“ But … I got hurt . … What ’s he playing at ? ”
119468	119475	119476	119476	Ron	196	“ Harry , do n’t complain ! ”
119506	119509	119510	119510	Ron	196	“ What ? ”
119514	119528	119510	119510	Ron	196	“ Four ? You lousy , biased scumbag , you gave Krum ten ! ”
119654	119668	119670	119671	Charlie Weasley	220	“ You ’re tied in first place , Harry ! You and Krum ! ”
119686	119755	119670	119671	Charlie Weasley	220	“ Listen , I ’ve got to run , I ’ve got to go and send Mum an owl , I swore I ’d tell her what happened — but that was unbelievable ! Oh yeah — and they told me to tell you you ’ve got to hang around for a few more minutes . … Bagman wants a word , back in the champions ’ tent . ”
119862	119868	119853	119853	He	247	“ Good one , Harry . ”
119869	119873	119875	119875	Harry	248	“ And you , ”
119880	119888	119890	119891	Ludo Bagman	230	“ Well done , all of you ! ”
119912	120031	119903	119903	he	230	“ Now , just a quick few words . You ’ve got a nice long break before the second task , which will take place at half past nine on the morning of February the twenty - fourth — but we ’re giving you something to think about in the meantime ! If you look down at those golden eggs you ’re all holding , you will see that they open … see the hinges there ? You need to solve the clue inside the egg — because it will tell you what the second task is , and enable you to prepare for it ! All clear ? Sure ? Well , off you go , then ! ”
120124	120129	120130	120130	she	333	“ Congratulations , Harry ! ”
120137	120168	120130	120130	she	333	“ I wonder if you could give me a quick word ? How you felt facing that dragon ? How you feel now , about the fairness of the scoring ? ”
120169	120178	120180	120180	Harry	248	“ Yeah , you can have a word , ”
120183	120188	120180	120180	Harry	248	“ Good - bye . ”
120297	120304	120305	120305	he	196	“ Fits , does n’t it ? ”
120308	120406	120305	120305	he	196	“ Remember what Malfoy said on the train , about his dad being friends with Karkaroff ? Now we know where they knew each other . They were probably running around in masks together at the World Cup . … I ’ll tell you one thing , though , Harry , if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet , he ’s going to be feeling really stupid now , is n’t he ? Did n’t work , did it ? You only got a scratch ! Come here — I ’ll do it — ”
120450	120472	120473	120473	Ron	196	“ There ’s no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous , how could they be ? ”
120484	120503	120477	120477	he	196	“ You know what ? I reckon you could win this tournament , Harry , I ’m serious . ”
120551	120566	120567	120567	she	186	“ Harry ’s got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament , ”
120571	120588	120567	120567	she	186	“ If that was the first task , I hate to think what ’s coming next . ”
120589	120600	120602	120602	Ron	196	“ Right little ray of sunshine , are n’t you ? ”
120604	120614	120602	120602	Ron	196	“ You and Professor Trelawney should get together sometime . ”
120693	120722	120690	120690	Ron	196	“ Well , we ’d better get downstairs for your surprise party , Harry — Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now . ”
120889	120896	120898	120899	Lee Jordan	396	“ Blimey , this is heavy , ”
120922	120940	120898	120899	Lee Jordan	396	“ Open it , Harry , go on ! Let ’s just see what ’s inside it ! ”
120941	120954	120955	120955	Hermione	186	“ He ’s supposed to work out the clue on his own , ”
120959	120968	120955	120955	Hermione	186	“ It ’s in the tournament rules . … ”
120969	120987	120988	120988	Harry	248	“ I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too , ”
121004	121015	121016	121017	several people	658	“ Yeah , go on , Harry , open it ! ”
121105	121109	121110	121110	Fred	200	“ Shut it ! ”
121119	121124	121126	121127	Seamus Finnigan	263	“ What was that ? ”
121140	121161	121126	121127	Seamus Finnigan	263	“ Sounded like a banshee . … Maybe you ’ve got to get past one of those next , Harry ! ”
121162	121169	121171	121171	Neville	349	“ It was someone being tortured ! ”
121187	121199	121171	121171	Neville	349	“ You ’re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse ! ”
121200	121213	121215	121215	George	201	“ Do n’t be a prat , Neville , that ’s illegal , ”
121217	121255	121215	121215	George	201	“ They would n’t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions . I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing … maybe you ’ve got to attack him while he ’s in the shower , Harry . ”
121256	121264	121266	121266	Fred	200	“ Want a jam tart , Hermione ? ”
121282	121288	121289	121289	he	248	“ It ’s all right , ”
121292	121312	121289	121289	he	248	“ I have n’t done anything to them . It ’s the custard creams you ’ve got to watch — ”
121333	121342	121330	121330	Fred	200	“ Just my little joke , Neville . … ”
121353	121365	121350	121350	she	186	“ Did you get all this from the kitchens , Fred ? ”
121366	121369	121371	121371	Fred	200	“ Yep , ”
121392	121424	121377	121377	He	248	“ ‘ Anything we can get you , sir , anything at all ! ’ They ’re dead helpful … get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish . ”
121425	121433	121434	121434	Hermione	186	“ How do you get in there ? ”
121444	121447	121449	121449	Fred	200	“ Easy , ”
121451	121473	121474	121474	He	248	“ concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit . Just tickle the pear , and it giggles and — ”
121482	121485	121474	121474	He	248	“ Why ? ”
121486	121489	121491	121491	Hermione	186	“ Nothing , ”
121494	121512	121514	121514	George	201	“ Going to try and lead the house - elves out on strike now , are you ? ”
121516	121534	121514	121514	George	201	“ Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion ? ”
121544	121563	121565	121565	Fred	200	“ Do n’t you go upsetting them and telling them they ’ve got to take clothes and salaries ! ”
121567	121576	121565	121565	Fred	200	“ You ’ll put them off their cooking ! ”
121592	121599	121600	121600	Fred	200	“ Oh — sorry , Neville ! ”
121607	121619	121600	121600	Fred	200	“ I forgot — it was the custard creams we hexed — ”
121650	121654	121655	121655	Fred	200	“ Canary Creams ! ”
121662	121676	121655	121655	Fred	200	“ George and I invented them — seven Sickles each , a bargain ! ”
121914	121925	121926	121926	Hagrid	205	“ I ’m not sure whether they hibernate or not , ”
121939	121967	121926	121926	Hagrid	205	“ Thought we ’d jus ’ try an ’ see if they fancied a kip … we ’ll jus ’ settle ’em down in these boxes . … ”
122060	122070	122071	122071	Hagrid	205	“ We ’ll jus ’ lead ’em in here , ”
122074	122089	122071	122071	Hagrid	205	“ an ’ put the lids on , and we ’ll see what happens . ”
122121	122132	122116	122116	Hagrid	205	“ Don ’ panic , now , don ’ panic ! ”
122233	122241	122242	122242	Hagrid	205	“ Don ’ frighten him , now ! ”
122278	122303	122242	122242	Hagrid	205	“ Jus ’ try an ’ slip the rope ’ round his sting , so he won ’ hurt any o ’ the others ! ”
122304	122313	122314	122314	Ron	196	“ Yeah , we would n’t want that ! ”
122339	122352	122314	122314	Ron	196	“ Well , well , well … this does look like fun . ”
122429	122434	122435	122435	Hagrid	205	“ Who ’re you ? ”
122455	122463	122464	122464	Rita	333	“ Rita Skeeter , Daily Prophet reporter , ”
122476	122489	122491	122491	Hagrid	205	“ Thought Dumbledore said you weren ’ allowed inside the school anymore , ”
122525	122533	122534	122534	she	333	“ What are these fascinating creatures called ? ”
122542	122548	122550	122550	Hagrid	205	“ Blast - Ended Skrewts , ”
122552	122555	122557	122557	Rita	333	“ Really ? ”
122565	122580	122557	122557	Rita	333	“ I ’ve never heard of them before … where do they come from ? ”
122624	122640	122610	122610	Hermione	186	“ They ’re very interesting , are n’t they ? Are n’t they , Harry ? ”
122641	122651	122653	122653	Harry	248	“ What ? Oh yeah … ouch … interesting , ”
122661	122670	122675	122675	she	333	“ Ah , you ’re here , Harry ! ”
122679	122697	122675	122675	she	333	“ So you like Care of Magical Creatures , do you ? One of your favorite lessons ? ”
122698	122701	122703	122703	Harry	248	“ Yes , ”
122711	122714	122716	122716	Rita	333	“ Lovely , ”
122718	122726	122727	122727	she	333	“ Really lovely . Been teaching long ? ”
122798	122806	122808	122808	Hagrid	205	“ This is o’ny me second year , ”
122810	122865	122808	122808	Hagrid	205	“ Lovely … I do n’t suppose you ’d like to give an interview , would you ? Share some of your experience of magical creatures ? The Prophet does a zoological column every Wednesday , as I ’m sure you know . We could feature these — er — Bang - Ended Scoots . ”
122866	122872	122873	122873	Hagrid	205	“ Blast - Ended Skrewts , ”
122877	122885	122873	122873	Hagrid	205	“ Er — yeah , why not ? ”
122957	122966	122967	122968	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Well , good - bye , Harry ! ”
122982	122991	122967	122968	Rita Skeeter	333	“ Until Friday night , then , Hagrid ! ”
122992	123000	123001	123001	Harry	248	“ She ’ll twist everything he says , ”
123007	123022	123024	123024	Hermione	186	“ Just as long as he did n’t import those skrewts illegally or anything , ”
123044	123061	123063	123063	Ron	196	“ Hagrid ’s been in loads of trouble before , and Dumbledore ’s never sacked him , ”
123066	123092	123063	123063	Ron	196	“ Worst that can happen is Hagrid’ll have to get rid of the skrewts . Sorry … did I say worst ? I meant best . ”
123190	123195	123196	123196	she	335	“ I would think , ”
123211	123216	123218	123218	she	335	“ that some of us ”
123225	123294	123218	123218	she	335	“ might be a little less frivolous had they seen what I have seen during my crystal gazing last night . As I sat here , absorbed in my needlework , the urge to consult the orb overpowered me . I arose , I settled myself before it , and I gazed into its crystalline depths … and what do you think I saw gazing back at me ? ”
123295	123304	123305	123305	Ron	196	“ An ugly old bat in outsize specs ? ”
123320	123326	123311	123311	Harry	248	“ Death , my dears . ”
123341	123344	123346	123347	Professor Trelawney	335	“ Yes , ”
123352	123376	123346	123347	Professor Trelawney	335	“ it comes , ever closer , it circles overhead like a vulture , ever lower … ever lower over the castle . … ”
123390	123409	123410	123410	Harry	248	“ It ’d be a bit more impressive if she had n’t done it about eighty times before , ”
123428	123453	123410	123410	Harry	248	“ But if I ’d dropped dead every time she ’s told me I ’m going to , I ’d be a medical miracle . ”
123454	123466	123468	123468	Ron	196	“ You ’d be a sort of extra - concentrated ghost , ”
123490	123517	123484	123484	his	3069	“ At least we did n’t get homework . I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector , I love not working when she is . … ”
123607	123615	123616	123616	Ron	196	“ Wonder where she ’s got to ? ”
123628	123633	123616	123616	Ron	196	“ Dunno … balderdash . ”
123657	123660	123661	123661	she	2112	“ Harry ! ”
123683	123707	123661	123661	she	2112	“ Harry , you ’ve got to come — you ’ve got to come , the most amazing thing ’s happened — please — ”
123725	123731	123732	123732	Harry	248	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
123735	123751	123708	123708	She	2112	“ I ’ll show you when we get there — oh come on , quick — ”
123766	123769	123770	123770	Harry	248	“ Okay , ”
123788	123795	123796	123798	the Fat Lady	2112	“ Oh do n’t mind me ! ”
123804	123829	123796	123798	the Fat Lady	2112	“ Do n’t apologize for bothering me ! I ’ll just hang here , wide open , until you get back , shall I ? ”
123830	123835	123836	123836	Ron	196	“ Yeah , thanks ! ”
123842	123850	123851	123851	Harry	248	“ Hermione , where are we going ? ”
123875	123887	123889	123889	Hermione	186	“ You ’ll see , you ’ll see in a minute ! ”
123992	123997	123999	123999	Harry	248	“ Oh hang on … ”
124007	124015	123999	123999	Harry	248	“ Wait a minute , Hermione . … ”
124016	124019	124020	124020	She	186	“ What ? ”
124034	124042	124044	124044	Harry	248	“ I know what this is about , ”
124066	124069	124071	124071	Ron	196	“ Hermione ! ”
124076	124089	124071	124071	Ron	196	“ You ’re trying to rope us into that spew stuff again ! ”
124090	124099	124100	124100	she	186	“ No , no , I ’m not ! ”
124104	124113	124100	124100	she	186	“ And it ’s not spew , Ron — ”
124114	124122	124124	124124	Ron	196	“ Changed the name , have you ? ”
124130	124166	124124	124124	Ron	196	“ What are we now , then , the House - Elf Liberation Front ? I ’m not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work , I ’m not doing it — ”
124167	124175	124176	124176	Hermione	186	“ I ’m not asking you to ! ”
124180	124210	124176	124176	Hermione	186	“ I came down here just now , to talk to them all , and I found — oh come on , Harry , I want to show you ! ”
124341	124350	124363	124365	the squealing elf	3094	“ Harry Potter , sir ! Harry Potter ! ”
124384	124389	124390	124390	Harry	162	“ D - Dobby ? ”
124393	124403	124363	124365	the squealing elf	3094	“ It is Dobby , sir , it is ! ”
124413	124438	124363	124365	the squealing elf	3094	“ Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter , sir , and Harry Potter has come to see him , sir ! ”

124661	124672	124673	124673	Dobby	481	“ Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts , sir ! ”
124677	124688	124673	124673	Dobby	481	“ Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs , sir ! ”
124689	124692	124694	124694	Harry	162	“ Winky ? ”
124696	124702	124694	124694	Harry	162	“ She ’s here too ? ”
124703	124710	124712	124712	Dobby	481	“ Yes , sir , yes ! ”
124870	124875	124876	124876	he	481	“ Winky , sir ! ”
124978	124983	124985	124985	Harry	162	“ Hello , Winky , ”
125023	125027	125031	125031	She	186	“ Oh dear , ”
125046	125057	125033	125033	Ron	196	“ Winky , do n’t cry , please do n’t … ”
125077	125087	125088	125088	he	162	“ Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea ? ”
125097	125104	125106	125106	Harry	162	“ Er — yeah , okay , ”
125151	125155	125156	125156	Ron	196	“ Good service ! ”
125183	125193	125194	125194	Harry	162	“ How long have you been here , Dobby ? ”
125203	125213	125215	125215	Dobby	481	“ Only a week , Harry Potter , sir ! ”
125218	125258	125215	125215	Dobby	481	“ Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore , sir . You see , sir , it is very difficult for a house - elf who has been dismissed to get a new position , sir , very difficult indeed — ”
125290	125308	125309	125309	Dobby	481	“ Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years , sir , trying to find work ! ”
125312	125328	125309	125309	Dobby	481	“ But Dobby has n’t found work , sir , because Dobby wants paying now ! ”
125370	125377	125364	125364	Hermione	186	“ Good for you , Dobby ! ”
125378	125384	125386	125386	Dobby	481	“ Thank you , miss ! ”
125393	125462	125386	125386	Dobby	481	“ But most wizards does n’t want a house - elf who wants paying , miss . ‘ That ’s not the point of a house - elf , ’ they says , and they slammed the door in Dobby ’s face ! Dobby likes work , but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid , Harry Potter . … Dobby likes being free ! ”
125506	125530	125532	125532	Dobby	481	“ And then , Harry Potter , Dobby goes to visit Winky , and finds out Winky has been freed too , sir ! ”
125603	125680	125590	125590	Dobby	481	“ And then Dobby had the idea , Harry Potter , sir ! ‘ Why does n’t Dobby and Winky find work together ? ’ Dobby says . ‘ Where is there enough work for two house - elves ? ’ says Winky . And Dobby thinks , and it comes to him , sir ! Hogwarts ! So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore , sir , and Professor Dumbledore took us on ! ”
125695	125736	125753	125753	Winky	286	“ And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby , sir , if Dobby wants paying ! And so Dobby is a free elf , sir , and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month ! ”
125737	125744	125745	125745	Hermione	186	“ That ’s not very much ! ”
125762	125776	125778	125778	Dobby	481	“ Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week , and weekends off , ”
125799	125830	125778	125778	Dobby	481	“ but Dobby beat him down , miss . … Dobby likes freedom , miss , but he is n’t wanting too much , miss , he likes work better . ”
125831	125843	125844	125844	Hermione	186	“ And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you , Winky ? ”
125893	125908	125909	125909	she	186	“ Winky is a disgraced elf , but Winky is not yet getting paid ! ”
125912	125930	125909	125909	she	186	“ Winky is not sunk so low as that ! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed ! ”
125931	125934	125936	125936	Hermione	186	“ Ashamed ? ”
125939	125973	125936	125936	Hermione	186	“ But — Winky , come on ! It ’s Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed , not you ! You did n’t do anything wrong , he was really horrible to you — ”
126005	126040	125981	125981	her	286	“ You is not insulting my master , miss ! You is not insulting Mr. Crouch ! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard , miss ! Mr. Crouch is right to sack bad Winky ! ”
126041	126051	126053	126053	Dobby	481	“ Winky is having trouble adjusting , Harry Potter , ”
126056	126084	126053	126053	Dobby	481	“ Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore ; she is allowed to speak her mind now , but she wo n’t do it . ”
126085	126100	126101	126101	Harry	248	“ Ca n’t house - elves speak their minds about their masters , then ? ”
126104	126112	126114	126114	Dobby	481	“ Oh no , sir , no , ”
126120	126181	126114	126114	Dobby	481	“ ’ Tis part of the house - elf ’s enslavement , sir . We keeps their secrets and our silence , sir . We upholds the family ’s honor , and we never speaks ill of them — though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this . Professor Dumbledore said we is free to — to — ”
126198	126219	126195	126195	Dobby	481	“ He said we is free to call him a — a barmy old codger if we likes , sir ! ”
126228	126239	126240	126240	he	481	“ But Dobby is not wanting to , Harry Potter , ”
126257	126280	126240	126240	he	481	“ Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much , sir , and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him . ”
126281	126294	126295	126295	Harry	162	“ But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now ? ”
126312	126318	126319	126319	he	481	“ Dobby — Dobby could , ”
126329	126347	126323	126323	He	481	“ Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were — were — bad Dark wizards ! ”
126386	126393	126367	126367	he	481	“ Bad Dobby ! Bad Dobby ! ”
126411	126421	126423	126423	Dobby	481	“ Thank you , Harry Potter , thank you , ”
126430	126439	126440	126440	Harry	162	“ You just need a bit of practice , ”
126443	126446	126448	126448	Winky	286	“ Practice ! ”
126451	126470	126448	126448	Winky	286	“ You is ought to be ashamed of yourself , Dobby , talking that way about your masters ! ”
126471	126481	126483	126483	Dobby	481	“ They is n’t my masters anymore , Winky ! ”
126486	126496	126483	126483	Dobby	481	“ Dobby does n’t care what they think anymore ! ”
126497	126507	126509	126509	Winky	286	“ Oh you is a bad elf , Dobby ! ”
126519	126590	126591	126591	She	3108	“ My poor Mr. Crouch , what is he doing without Winky ? He is needing me , he is needing my help ! I is looking after the Crouches all my life , and my mother is doing it before me , and my grandmother is doing it before her … oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was freed ? Oh the shame , the shame ! ”
126602	126605	126607	126607	Hermione	186	“ Winky , ”
126610	126633	126607	126607	Hermione	186	“ I ’m quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you . We ’ve seen him , you know — ”
126634	126641	126643	126643	Winky	286	“ You is seeing my master ? ”
126661	126670	126659	126659	Hermione	186	“ You is seeing him here at Hogwarts ? ”
126671	126674	126676	126676	Hermione	186	“ Yes , ”
126678	126692	126676	126676	Hermione	186	“ he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Tri - wizard Tournament . ”
126693	126699	126701	126701	Winky	286	“ Mr. Bagman comes too ? ”
126731	126758	126726	126726	she	286	“ Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard ! A very bad wizard ! My master is n’t liking him , oh no , not at all ! ”
126759	126764	126766	126766	Harry	248	“ Bagman — bad ? ”
126768	126772	126773	126773	Winky	286	“ Oh yes , ”
126781	126806	126777	126777	her	286	“ My master is telling Winky some things ! But Winky is not saying … Winky — Winky keeps her master ’s secrets . … ”
126823	126837	126817	126817	her	286	“ Poor master , poor master , no Winky to help him no more !
126878	126891	126892	126892	he	481	“ Dobby is going to buy a sweater next , Harry Potter ! ”
126902	126909	126911	126911	Ron	196	“ Tell you what , Dobby , ”
126925	126955	126911	126911	Ron	196	“ I ’ll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas , I always get one from her . You do n’t mind maroon , do you ? ”
126960	126973	126974	126974	Ron	196	“ We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you , ”
126978	126989	126974	126974	Ron	196	“ but it ’ll go well with your tea cozy . ”
127045	127050	127051	127051	Harry	162	“ Thanks a lot ! ”
127069	127075	127051	127051	Harry	162	“ See you , Dobby ! ”
127076	127090	127091	127091	Dobby	481	“ Harry Potter … can Dobby come and see you sometimes , sir ? ”
127095	127101	127103	127103	Harry	162	“ ’ Course you can , ”
127109	127114	127116	127116	Ron	196	“ You know what ? ”
127141	127181	127124	127124	Harry	162	“ All these years I ’ve been really impressed with Fred and George , nicking food from the kitchens — well , it ’s not exactly difficult , is it ? They ca n’t wait to give it away ! ”
127182	127201	127203	127203	Hermione	186	“ I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves , you know , ”
127214	127250	127203	127203	Hermione	186	“ Dobby coming to work here , I mean . The other elves will see how happy he is , being free , and slowly it ’ll dawn on them that they want that too ! ”
127251	127264	127266	127266	Harry	162	“ Let ’s hope they do n’t look too closely at Winky , ”
127268	127275	127280	127280	she	186	“ Oh she ’ll cheer up , ”
127286	127316	127280	127280	she	186	“ Once the shock ’s worn off , and she ’s got used to Hogwarts , she ’ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man . ”
127317	127324	127326	127326	Ron	196	“ She seems to love him , ”
127339	127352	127354	127354	Harry	162	“ Does n’t think much of Bagman , though , does she ? ”
127356	127366	127354	127354	Harry	162	“ Wonder what Crouch says at home about him ? ”
127367	127380	127382	127382	Hermione	186	“ Probably says he ’s not a very good Head of Department , ”
127384	127401	127382	127382	Hermione	186	“ and let ’s face it … he ’s got a point , has n’t he ? ”
127402	127414	127416	127416	Ron	196	“ I ’d still rather work for him than old Crouch , ”
127418	127429	127416	127416	Ron	196	“ At least Bagman ’s got a sense of humor . ”
127430	127440	127441	127441	Hermione	186	“ Do n’t let Percy hear you saying that , ”
127447	127469	127471	127471	Ron	196	“ Yeah , well , Percy would n’t want to work for anyone with a sense of humor , would he ? ”
127480	127501	127471	127471	Ron	196	“ Percy would n’t recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby ’s tea cozy . ”
127507	127517	127518	127519	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Potter ! Weasley ! Will you pay attention ? ”
127599	127620	127589	127589	they	3121	“ Describe , with examples , the ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross - Species Switches ”
127677	127692	127694	127695	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age , ”
127732	127741	127721	127721	Ron	196	“ I have something to say to you all .
127742	127795	127796	127797	Lavender Brown	402	“ The Yule Ball is approaching — a traditional part of the Tri - wizard Tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests . Now , the ball will be open only to fourth years and above — although you may invite a younger student if you wish — ”
127854	127861	127862	127863	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Dress robes will be worn , ”
127866	127890	127862	127863	Professor McGonagall	194	“ and the ball will start at eight o’clock on Christmas Day , finishing at midnight in the Great Hall . Now then — ”
127899	127920	127921	127921	she	194	“ The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to — er — let our hair down , ”
127982	127989	127990	127991	Professor McGonagall	194	“ But that does NOT mean , ”
127995	128028	127990	127991	Professor McGonagall	194	“ that we will be relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from Hogwarts students . I will be most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way . ”
128060	128070	128053	128054	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Potter — a word , if you please . ”
128108	128117	128092	128093	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Potter , the champions and their partners — ”
128118	128122	128124	128124	Harry	162	“ What partners ? ”
128144	128154	128155	128155	she	194	“ Your partners for the Yule Ball , Potter , ”
128159	128164	128155	128155	she	194	“ Your dance partners . ”
128175	128179	128180	128180	He	162	“ Dance partners ? ”

128210	128230	128206	128207	Professor McGonagall	194	“ That ’s what I ’m telling you . Traditionally , the champions and their partners open the ball . ”

128277	128282	128284	128285	Professor McGonagall	194	“ It is traditional , ”
128288	128322	128284	128285	Professor McGonagall	194	“ You are a Hogwarts champion , and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school . So make sure you get yourself a partner , Potter . ”
128323	128330	128340	128341	Professor McGonagall	194	“ But — I do n’t — ”
128331	128338	128340	128341	Professor McGonagall	194	“ You heard me , Potter , ”
128553	128563	128564	128564	Harry	162	“ Why do they have to move in packs ? ”

128607	128618	128604	128604	Ron	196	“ Got any idea who you ’re going to try ? ”
128687	128724	128674	128674	Ron	196	“ Listen , you ’re not going to have any trouble . You ’re a champion . You ’ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail . I bet they ’ll be queuing up to go with you . ”
128877	128885	128887	128887	Ron	196	“ She was quite good - looking , ”

129269	129344	129262	129262	Hagrid	205	“ Well , I told her we ’d been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the Dursleys . ‘ Never had to tell him off in four years ? ’ she said . ‘ Never played you up in lessons , has he ? ’ I told her no , an ’ she didn ’ seem happy at all . Yeh’d think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible , Harry . ”

132765	132776	132763	132763	Ron	196	“ You just said that to get rid of Neville ! ”
132777	132782	132784	132784	Hermione	186	“ Oh did I ? ”
132792	132819	132787	132787	her	186	“ Just because it ’s taken you three years to notice , Ron , does n’t mean no one else has spotted I ’m a girl ! ”
132830	132842	132843	132843	he	196	“ Okay , okay , we know you ’re a girl , ”

134611	134634	134599	134599	Harry	491	“ ‘ Constant vigilance ! ’ You ’d think I walk around with my eyes shut , banging off the walls . … ”
134635	134643	134645	134645	Hermione	186	“ But he ’s right , Harry , ”
134647	134680	134645	134645	Hermione	186	“ you have still got two tasks to do . You really ought to have a look at that egg , you know , and start working out what it means . … ”
134681	134689	134691	134691	Ron	196	“ Hermione , he ’s got ages ! ”
134693	134702	134691	134691	Ron	196	“ Want a game of chess , Harry ? ”
134703	134708	134710	134710	Harry	491	“ Yeah , okay , ”
134725	134755	134722	134722	he	491	“ Come on , how’m I supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on ? I wo n’t even be able to hear the egg over this lot . ”
134756	134762	134763	134763	she	186	“ Oh I suppose not , ”
134850	134853	134854	134854	Harry	491	“ Dobby ! ”
134871	134877	134854	134854	Harry	491	“ Do n’t do that ! ”
134878	134885	134887	134887	Dobby	481	“ Dobby is sorry , sir ! ”
134900	134935	134893	134893	his	481	“ Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter ‘ Merry Christmas ’ and bring him a present , sir ! Harry Potter did say Dobby could come and see him sometimes , sir ! ”
134936	134941	134943	134943	Harry	162	“ It ’s okay , ”
134960	134983	134943	134943	Harry	162	“ Just — just prod me or something in future , all right , do n’t bend over me like that . … ”
135042	135049	135050	135050	Seamus	263	“ Someone attacking you , Harry ? ”
135054	135062	135063	135063	Harry	162	“ No , it ’s just Dobby , ”
135066	135072	135063	135063	Harry	162	“ Go back to sleep . ”
135073	135078	135080	135080	Seamus	263	“ Nah … presents ! ”
135160	135169	135170	135170	he	481	“ Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present ? ”
135174	135180	135182	135182	Harry	162	“ ’ Course you can , ”
135184	135195	135182	135182	Harry	162	“ Er … I ’ve got something for you too . ”
135286	135296	135272	135272	He	162	“ Sorry , I forgot to wrap them . … ”
135303	135315	135316	135316	he	481	“ Socks are Dobby ’s favorite , favorite clothes , sir ! ”
135331	135343	135344	135344	he	481	“ I has seven now , sir . … But sir … ”
135372	135393	135344	135344	he	481	“ they has made a mistake in the shop , Harry Potter , they is giving you two the same ! ”
135394	135409	135411	135411	Ron	196	“ Ah , no , Harry , how come you did n’t spot that ? ”
135428	135457	135411	135411	Ron	196	“ Tell you what , Dobby — here you go — take these two , and you can mix them up properly . And here ’s your sweater . ”
135487	135493	135494	135494	he	481	“ Sir is very kind ! ”
135509	135548	135494	135494	he	481	“ Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard , for he is Harry Potter ’s greatest friend , but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit , as noble , as selfless — ”
135549	135555	135557	135557	Ron	196	“ They ’re only socks , ”
135577	135582	135569	135569	he	196	“ Wow , Harry — ”
135596	135599	135600	135600	He	196	“ Cool ! ”
135631	135640	135641	135642	the elf	1327	“ Dobby is making them himself , sir ! ”
135646	135659	135641	135642	the elf	1327	“ He is buying the wool out of his wages , sir ! ”
135686	135700	135702	135702	Harry	162	“ They ’re … they ’re really … well , thanks , Dobby , ”
135720	135738	135740	135740	Dobby	481	“ Dobby must go now , sir , we is already making Christmas dinner in the kitchens ! ”
136068	136076	136078	136078	Ron	196	“ What , you need three hours ? ”
136110	136117	136118	136118	he	196	“ Who ’re you going with ? ”
136212	136221	136222	136222	she	2112	“ Lairy fights , that ’s the one ! ”
136373	136393	136395	136395	Dean	174	“ I still ca n’t work out how you two got the best - looking girls in the year , ”
136397	136401	136403	136403	Ron	196	“ Animal magnetism , ”
136486	136494	136495	136495	he	162	“ You — er — look nice , ”
136499	136502	136503	136503	she	363	“ Thanks , ”
136506	136518	136519	136519	she	363	“ Padma ’s going to meet you in the entrance hall , ”
136524	136527	136529	136529	Ron	196	“ Right , ”
136534	136539	136529	136529	Ron	196	“ Where ’s Hermione ? ”
136543	136552	136540	136540	Parvati	363	“ Shall we go down then , Harry ? ”
136553	136556	136558	136558	Harry	162	“ Okay , ”
136652	136655	136657	136657	Padma	490	“ Hi , ”
136710	136713	136715	136715	Ron	196	“ Hi , ”
136729	136733	136715	136715	Ron	196	“ Oh no … ”
136789	136794	136795	136795	he	196	“ Where is Hermione ? ”
137002	137009	136996	136997	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Champions over here , please ! ”
137021	137027	137019	137019	Harry	440	“ See you in a minute ”
137311	137316	137317	137317	she	186	“ Hi , Harry ! ”
137320	137325	137317	137317	she	186	“ Hi , Parvati ! ”
137768	137774	137775	137775	Percy	214	“ I ’ve been promoted , ”
137802	137819	137788	137788	he	214	“ I ’m now Mr. Crouch ’s personal assistant , and I ’m here representing him . ”
137820	137827	137828	137828	Harry	248	“ Why did n’t he come ? ”
137846	138047	137788	137788	he	214	“ I ’m afraid to say Mr. Crouch is n’t well , not well at all . Has n’t been right since the World Cup . Hardly surprising — overwork . He ’s not as young as he was — though still quite brilliant , of course , the mind remains as great as it ever was . But the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry , and then , Mr. Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that house - elf of his , Blinky , or whatever she was called . Naturally , he dismissed her immediately afterward , but — well , as I say , he ’s getting on , he needs looking after , and I think he ’s found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left . And then we had the tournament to arrange , and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with — that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around — no , poor man , he ’s having a well earned , quiet Christmas . I ’m just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place . ”
138061	138063	138055	138056	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Weatherby ”
138129	138133	138117	138117	his	195	“ Pork chops ! ”
138249	138272	138273	138273	he	248	“ Veil , ve have a castle also , not as big as this , nor as comfortable , I am thinking , ”
138278	138337	138273	138273	he	248	“ Ve have just four floors , and the fires are lit only for magical purposes . But ve have grounds larger even than these — though in vinter , ve have very little daylight , so ve are not enjoying them . But in summer ve are flying every day , over the lakes and the mountains — ”
138338	138345	138347	138347	Karkaroff	430	“ Now , now , Viktor ! ”
138359	138382	138347	138347	Karkaroff	430	“ do n’t go giving away anything else , now , or your charming friend will know exactly where to find us ! ”
138390	138407	138383	138383	Dumbledore	195	“ Igor , all this secrecy … one would almost think you did n’t want visitors . ”
138408	138413	138415	138415	Karkaroff	430	“ Well , Dumbledore , ”
138426	138478	138415	138415	Karkaroff	430	“ we are all protective of our private domains , are we not ? Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us ? Are we not right to be proud that we alone know our school ’s secrets , and right to protect them ? ”
138479	138496	138498	138498	Dumbledore	195	“ Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts ’ secrets , Igor , ”
138501	138604	138498	138498	Dumbledore	195	“ Only this morning , for instance , I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before , containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots . When I went back to investigate more closely , I discovered that the room had vanished . But I must keep an eye out for it . Possibly it is only accessible at five - thirty in the morning . Or it may only appear at the quarter moon — or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder . ”
138642	138647	138648	138648	she	3334	“ Zis is nothing , ”
138663	138759	138760	138760	She	3334	“ At ze Palace of Beauxbatons , we ’ ave ice sculptures all around ze dining chamber at Chreestmas . Zey do not melt , of course … zey are like ’ uge statues of diamond , glittering around ze place . And ze food is seemply superb . And we ’ ave choirs of wood nymphs , ’ oo serenade us as we eat . We ’ ave none of zis ugly armor in ze ’ alls , and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into Beauxbatons , ’ e would be expelled like zat . ”
138815	138819	138820	138820	he	248	“ Absolutely right , ”
138837	138843	138820	138820	he	248	“ Like that . Yeah . ”
138918	138923	138914	138914	he	248	“ Hermy - own . ”
138924	138933	138934	138934	she	186	“ Her - my - oh - nee , ”
138940	138947	138914	138914	he	248	“ Herm - own - ninny . ”
138948	138952	138953	138953	she	186	“ Close enough , ”
139125	139129	139130	139130	Parvati	363	“ Come on ! ”
139133	139140	139130	139130	Parvati	363	“ We ’re supposed to dance ! ”
139363	139369	139370	139370	Moody	344	“ Nice socks , Potter , ”
139385	139400	139402	139402	Harry	162	“ Oh — yeah , Dobby the house - elf knitted them for me , ”
139406	139412	139413	139413	Parvati	363	“ He is so creepy ! ”
139420	139431	139413	139413	Parvati	363	“ I do n’t think that eye should be allowed ! ”
139467	139476	139459	139459	Harry	162	“ Let ’s sit down , shall we ? ”
139477	139489	139490	139490	Parvati	363	“ Oh — but — this is a really good one ! ”
139507	139516	139517	139517	Harry	162	“ No , I do n’t like it , ”
139564	139570	139571	139571	Harry	162	“ How ’s it going ? ”
139668	139679	139680	139680	Parvati	363	“ You do n’t mind , do you , Harry ? ”
139683	139686	139688	139688	Harry	162	“ What ? ”
139698	139703	139705	139705	Parvati	363	“ Oh never mind , ”
139750	139753	139755	139755	Harry	162	“ Hi , ”
139763	139772	139777	139777	herself	186	“ It ’s hot , is n’t it ? ”
139782	139792	139777	139777	herself	186	“ Viktor ’s just gone to get some drinks . ”
139800	139803	139804	139804	he	196	“ Viktor ? ”
139807	139819	139804	139804	he	196	“ Has n’t he asked you to call him Vicky yet ? ”
139827	139834	139835	139835	she	186	“ What ’s up with you ? ”
139838	139845	139847	139847	Ron	196	“ If you do n’t know , ”
139850	139859	139847	139847	Ron	196	“ I ’m not going to tell you . ”
139872	139878	139860	139860	Hermione	186	“ Ron , what — ? ”
139879	139885	139887	139887	Ron	196	“ He ’s from Durmstrang ! ”
139889	139904	139905	139905	Ron	196	“ He ’s competing against Harry ! Against Hogwarts ! You — you ’re — ”
139920	139933	139905	139905	Ron	196	“ fraternizing with the enemy , that ’s what you ’re doing ! ”
139940	139947	139948	139948	she	186	“ Do n’t be so stupid ! ”
139954	139995	139948	139948	she	186	“ The enemy ! Honestly — who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive ? Who was the one who wanted his autograph ? Who ’s got a model of him up in their dormitory ? ”
140002	140020	139996	139996	Ron	196	“ I s’pose he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library ? ”
140021	140027	140029	140029	Hermione	186	“ Yes , he did , ”
140041	140045	140029	140029	Hermione	186	“ So what ? ”
140046	140061	139996	139996	Ron	196	“ What happened — trying to get him to join spew , were you ? ”
140062	140109	140029	140029	Hermione	186	“ No , I was n’t ! If you really want to know , he — he said he ’d been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me , but he had n’t been able to pluck up the courage ! ”
140131	140141	140143	140143	Ron	196	“ Yeah , well — that ’s his story , ”
140146	140155	140029	140029	Hermione	186	“ And what ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
140156	140206	140207	140207	Hermione	186	“ Obvious , is n’t it ? He ’s Karkaroff ’s student , is n’t he ? He knows who you hang around with . … He ’s just trying to get closer to Harry — get inside information on him — or get near enough to jinx him — ”
140224	140243	140217	140217	she	186	“ For your information , he has n’t asked me one single thing about Harry , not one — ”
140253	140285	140244	140244	Ron	196	“ Then he ’s hoping you ’ll help him find out what his egg means ! I suppose you ’ve been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions — ”
140286	140297	140299	140299	Hermione	186	“ I ’d never help him work out that egg ! ”
140304	140333	140299	140299	Hermione	186	“ Never . How could you say something like that — I want Harry to win the tournament , Harry knows that , do n’t you , Harry ? ”
140334	140345	140347	140347	Ron	196	“ You ’ve got a funny way of showing it , ”
140349	140369	140371	140371	Hermione	186	“ This whole tournament ’s supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them ! ”
140374	140380	140382	140382	Ron	196	“ No it is n’t ! ”
140384	140390	140382	140382	Ron	196	“ It ’s about winning ! ”
140399	140402	140404	140404	Harry	162	“ Ron , ”
140407	140420	140404	140404	Harry	162	“ I have n’t got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum — ”
140427	140445	140447	140447	Ron	196	“ Why do n’t you go and find Vicky , he ’ll be wondering where you are , ”
140449	140456	140447	140447	Ron	196	“ Do n’t call him Vicky ! ”
140490	140502	140503	140503	Padma	490	“ Are you going to ask me to dance at all ? ”
140507	140510	140512	140512	Ron	196	“ No , ”
140519	140522	140524	140524	Padma	490	“ Fine , ”
140567	140576	140557	140557	he	162	“ Vare is Herm - own - ninny ? ”
140592	140596	140598	140598	Ron	196	“ No idea , ”
140606	140613	140598	140598	Ron	196	“ Lost her , have you ? ”
140620	140634	140635	140635	he	234	“ Veil , if you see her , tell her I haff drinks , ”
140643	140655	140656	140656	Percy	282	“ Made friends with Viktor Krum , have you , Ron ? ”
140670	140686	140656	140656	Percy	282	“ Excellent ! That ’s the whole point , you know — international magical cooperation ! ”
140788	140802	140803	140803	Percy	282	“ What do they think they ’re doing , annoying senior Ministry members ? ”
140812	140816	140803	140803	Percy	282	“ No respect … ”
140842	140855	140857	140857	Percy	282	“ I hope my brothers were n’t bothering you , Mr. Bagman ? ”
140861	140873	140875	140875	Bagman	230	“ What ? Oh not at all , not at all ! ”
140877	140927	140875	140875	Bagman	230	“ No , they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs . Wondering if I could advise them on the marketing . I ’ve promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko ’s Joke Shop . … ”
140997	141023	141025	141025	he	230	“ How do you feel the tournament ’s going , Mr. Bagman ? Our department ’s quite satisfied — the hitch with the Goblet of Fire ”
141030	141054	141025	141025	he	230	“ was a little unfortunate , of course , but it seems to have gone very smoothly since , do n’t you think ? ”
141055	141059	141060	141060	Bagman	230	“ Oh yes , ”
141064	141084	141060	141060	Bagman	230	“ it ’s all been enormous fun . How ’s old Barty doing ? Shame he could n’t come . ”
141085	141101	141103	141103	Percy	282	“ Oh I ’m sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time , ”
141106	141132	141134	141134	he	282	“ but in the meantime , I ’m more than willing to take up the slack . Of course , it ’s not all attending balls ”

142927	142958	142920	142920	Ron	196	“ I always thought he ’d got in the way of a bad Engorgement Charm when he was a kid or something . Did n’t like to mention it . … ”
142959	142972	142974	142974	Harry	248	“ But what ’s it matter if his mother was a giantess ? ”

143001	143050	142998	142998	Ron	196	“ But … Harry , they ’re just vicious , giants . It ’s like Hagrid said , it ’s in their natures , they ’re like trolls … they just like killing , everyone knows that . There are n’t any left in Britain now , though . ”
143051	143057	142920	142920	Ron	196	“ What happened to them ? ”
143058	143095	142998	142998	Ron	196	“ Well , they were dying out anyway , and then loads got themselves killed by Aurors . There ’re supposed to be giants abroad , though . … They hide out in mountains mostly . … ”

143127	143156	143113	143114	Madame Maxime	322	“ If Hagrid ’s half - giant , she definitely is . Big bones … the only thing that ’s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur . ”

143833	143845	143827	143827	he	248	“ well — that just proves — completely missed the point — ”
143948	143961	143962	143962	she	186	“ but it ’s way too much bother to do every day , ”
144051	144060	144061	144061	she	186	“ Well , I thought he must be , ”
144066	144123	144061	144061	she	186	“ I knew he could n’t be pure giant because they ’re about twenty feet tall . But honestly , all this hysteria about giants . They ca n’t all be horrible . … It ’s the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves . … It ’s just bigotry , is n’t it ? ”
144665	144678	144679	144679	she	3426	“ Hurry up , now , the bell rang five minutes ago , ”
144692	144697	144699	144699	Ron	196	“ Who ’re you ? ”

145184	145200	145181	145181	Malfoy	290	“ No , he ’s just too ashamed to show his big , ugly face . ”

146293	146317	146274	146275	Parvati Patil	363	“ That ’s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like … proper creatures like unicorns , not monsters . … ”
146318	146323	146324	146324	Harry	162	“ What about Hagrid ? ”
146334	146339	146341	146341	Parvati	363	“ What about him ? ”
146347	146358	146341	146341	Parvati	363	“ He can still be gamekeeper , ca n’t he ? ”

146543	146580	146536	146536	himself	162	“ He never even told us , did he ? I reckon she was so mad he would n’t give her loads of horrible stuff about me , she went ferreting around to get him back . ”
146581	146593	146595	146595	Hermione	186	“ Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball , ”
146598	146608	146610	146610	Ron	196	“ We ’d have seen her in the garden ! ”
146612	146632	146610	146610	Ron	196	“ Anyway , she ’s not supposed to come into school anymore , Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her . … ”
146633	146642	146644	146644	Harry	162	“ Maybe she ’s got an Invisibility Cloak , ”
146660	146679	146644	146644	Harry	162	“ Sort of thing she ’d do , is n’t it , hide in bushes listening to people . ”
146680	146690	146692	146692	Hermione	186	“ Like you and Ron did , you mean , ”
146694	146703	146705	146705	Ron	196	“ We were n’t trying to hear him ! ”
146708	146732	146705	146705	Ron	196	“ We did n’t have any choice ! The stupid prat , talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard him ! ”
146733	146743	146745	146745	Harry	162	“ We ’ve got to go and see him , ”
146747	146767	146768	146768	he	162	“ This evening , after Divination . Tell him we want him back … you do want him back ? ”
146773	146815	146816	146816	Hermione	186	“ I — well , I ’m not going to pretend it did n’t make a nice change , having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once — but I do want Hagrid back , of course I do ! ”
146864	146871	146872	146872	Harry	162	“ Hagrid , it ’s us ! ”

146932	146940	146941	146941	Hermione	186	“ What ’s he avoiding us for ? ”
146957	146973	146941	146941	Hermione	186	“ He surely does n’t think we ’d care about him being half - giant ? ”
147041	147049	147050	147050	he	290	“ Missing your half - breed pal ? ”
147072	147079	147050	147050	he	290	“ Missing the elephant - man ? ”
147100	147117	147118	147118	she	186	“ I just thought you ’d want to take advantage of the common room being quiet , ”
147121	147130	147118	147118	she	186	“ Really get to work on that egg . ”
147131	147150	147151	147151	Harry	162	“ Oh I — I reckon I ’ve got a pretty good idea what it ’s about now , ”
147154	147159	147161	147161	Hermione	186	“ Have you really ? ”
147166	147170	147161	147161	Hermione	186	“ Well done ! ”
147319	147324	147326	147326	Harry	162	“ He ’s mad ! ”
147345	147355	147326	147326	Harry	162	“ It must be freezing , it ’s January ! ”
147356	147367	147369	147369	Hermione	186	“ It ’s a lot colder where he comes from , ”
147371	147381	147369	147369	Hermione	186	“ I suppose it feels quite warm to him . ”
147382	147393	147395	147395	Ron	196	“ Yeah , but there ’s still the giant squid , ”
147419	147428	147429	147429	she	186	“ He ’s really nice , you know , ”
147432	147458	147429	147429	she	186	“ He ’s not at all like you ’d think , coming from Durmstrang . He likes it much better here , he told me . ”
147618	147628	147629	147629	Hermione	186	“ Does n’t he ever go into the office ? ”
147633	147636	147629	147629	Hermione	186	“ Look ! ”
147773	147782	147785	147785	him	230	“ In a moment , in a moment ! ”
147808	147811	147812	147812	he	230	“ Harry ! ”
147815	147832	147812	147812	he	230	“ How are you ? Been hoping to run into you ! Everything going all right ? ”
147833	147838	147840	147840	Harry	162	“ Fine , thanks , ”
147842	147856	147858	147858	Bagman	230	“ Wonder if I could have a quick , private word , Harry ? ”
147861	147876	147858	147858	Bagman	230	“ You could n’t give us a moment , you two , could you ? ”
147877	147882	147884	147884	Ron	196	“ Er — okay , ”
147911	147932	147934	147934	Bagman	230	“ Well , I just thought I ’d congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that Horntail , Harry , ”
147936	147940	147934	147934	Bagman	230	“ Really superb . ”
147941	147944	147946	147946	Harry	162	“ Thanks , ”
148020	148024	148026	148026	Bagman	230	“ Absolute nightmare , ”
148040	148115	148026	148026	Bagman	230	“ Their English is n’t too good … it ’s like being back with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup … but at least they used sign language another human could recognize . This lot keep gabbling in Gobbledegook … and I only know one word of Gobbledegook . Bladvak . It means ‘ pickax . ’ I do n’t like to use it in case they think I ’m threatening them . ”
148124	148130	148131	148131	Harry	162	“ What do they want ? ”
148145	148150	148152	148152	Bagman	230	“ Er — well … ”
148158	148170	148152	148152	Bagman	230	“ They … er … they ’re looking for Barry Crouch . ”
148171	148180	148182	148182	Harry	162	“ Why are they looking for him here ? ”
148184	148197	148182	148182	Harry	162	“ He ’s at the Ministry in London , is n’t he ? ”
148198	148215	148217	148217	Bagman	230	“ Er … as a matter of fact , I ’ve no idea where he is , ”
148219	148311	148217	148217	Bagman	230	“ He ’s sort of … stopped coming to work . Been absent for a couple of weeks now . Young Percy , his assistant , says he ’s ill . Apparently he ’s just been sending instructions in by owl . But would you mind not mentioning that to anyone , Harry ? Because Rita Skeeter ’s still poking around everywhere she can , and I ’m willing to bet she ’d work up Barty ’s illness into something sinister . Probably say he ’s gone missing like Bertha Jorkins . ”
148312	148321	148322	148322	Harry	162	“ Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins ? ”
148325	148328	148330	148330	Bagman	230	“ No , ”
148336	148346	148330	148330	Bagman	230	“ I ’ve got people looking , of course … ”
148354	148448	148450	148450	he	3523	“ and it ’s all very strange . She definitely arrived in Albania , because she met her second cousin there . And then she left the cousin ’s house to go south and see an aunt … and she seems to have vanished without trace en route . Blowed if I can see where she ’s got to … she does n’t seem the type to elope , for instance … but still . … What are we doing , talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins ? I really wanted to ask you ”
148455	148466	148452	148452	his	3523	“ how are you getting on with your golden egg ? ”
148467	148473	148474	148474	Harry	162	“ Er … not bad , ”
148488	148493	148494	148494	he	230	“ Listen , Harry , ”
148505	148531	148533	148533	his	230	“ I feel very bad about all this … you were thrown into this tournament , you did n’t volunteer for it … and if … ”
148548	148587	148533	148533	his	230	“ if I can help at all … a prod in the right direction … I ’ve taken a liking to you … the way you got past that dragon ! … well , just say the word . ”
148607	148622	148623	148623	he	162	“ We ’re supposed to work out the clues alone , are n’t we ? ”
148655	148662	148664	148664	Bagman	230	“ Well … well , yes , ”
148667	148686	148664	148664	Bagman	230	“ but — come on , Harry — we all want a Hogwarts victory , do n’t we ? ”
148687	148694	148695	148695	Harry	162	“ Have you offered Cedric help ? ”
148708	148715	148716	148716	he	230	“ No , I have n’t , ”
148719	148742	148716	148716	he	230	“ I — well , like I say , I ’ve taken a liking to you . Just thought I ’d offer … ”
148743	148748	148750	148750	Harry	162	“ Well , thanks , ”
148752	148771	148750	148750	Harry	162	“ but I think I ’m nearly there with the egg … couple more days should crack it . ”
148838	148844	148846	148846	Fred	200	“ Hello , Mr. Bagman , ”
148849	148857	148846	148846	Fred	200	“ Can we buy you a drink ? ”
148858	148863	148865	148865	Bagman	230	“ Er … no , ”
148875	148883	148865	148865	Bagman	230	“ no , thank you , boys … ”
148907	148914	148915	148915	he	230	“ Well , I must dash , ”
148918	148929	148915	148915	he	230	“ Nice seeing you all . Good luck , Harry . ”
148957	148963	148964	148964	Ron	196	“ What did he want ? ”
148974	148985	148987	148987	Harry	162	“ He offered to help me with the golden egg , ”
148989	148997	148999	148999	Hermione	186	“ He should n’t be doing that ! ”
149005	149027	148999	148999	Hermione	186	“ He ’s one of the judges ! And anyway , you ’ve already worked it out — have n’t you ? ”
149028	149033	149035	149035	Harry	162	“ Er … nearly , ”
149037	149060	149062	149062	Hermione	186	“ Well , I do n’t think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat ! ”
149069	149081	149062	149062	Hermione	186	“ I hope he ’s trying to help Cedric as much ! ”
149082	149090	149092	149092	Harry	162	“ He ’s not , I asked , ”
149094	149103	149105	149105	Ron	196	“ Who cares if Diggory ’s getting help ? ”
149111	149120	149122	149122	Hermione	186	“ Those goblins did n’t look very friendly , ”
149128	149135	149122	149122	Hermione	186	“ What were they doing here ? ”
149136	149145	149147	149147	Harry	162	“ Looking for Crouch , according to Bagman , ”
149149	149161	149147	149147	Harry	162	“ He ’s still ill . Has n’t been into work . ”
149162	149169	149171	149171	Ron	196	“ Maybe Percy ’s poisoning him , ”
149173	149193	149171	149171	Ron	196	“ Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it he ’ll be made head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation . ”
149214	149240	149194	149194	Hermione	186	“ Funny , goblins looking for Mr. Crouch . … They ’d normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures . ”
149241	149252	149254	149254	Harry	248	“ Crouch can speak loads of different languages , though , ”
149256	149263	149254	149254	Harry	248	“ Maybe they need an interpreter . ”
149264	149277	149278	149278	Ron	196	“ Worrying about poor ’ ickle goblins , now , are you ? ”
149282	149299	149278	149278	Ron	196	“ Thinking of starting up S.P.U.G. or something ? Society for the Protection of Ugly Goblins ? ”
149300	149307	149309	149309	Hermione	186	“ Ha , ha , ha , ”
149312	149336	149309	149309	Hermione	186	“ Goblins do n’t need protection . Have n’t you been listening to what Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin rebellions ? ”
149337	149340	149342	149342	Harry	248	“ No , ”
149347	149359	149361	149361	Hermione	186	“ Well , they ’re quite capable of dealing with wizards , ”
149369	149390	149361	149361	Hermione	186	“ They ’re very clever . They ’re not like house - elves , who never stick up for themselves . ”
149391	149396	149398	149398	Ron	196	“ Uh - oh , ”
149481	149586	149470	149470	She	333	“ … did n’t seem very keen to talk to us , did he , Bozo ? Now , why would that be , do you think ? And what ’s he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway ? Showing them the sights … what nonsense … he was always a bad liar . Reckon something ’s up ? Think we should do a bit of digging ? ‘ Disgraced Ex - Head of Magical Games and Sports , Ludo Bagman … ’ Snappy start to a sentence , Bozo — we just need to find a story to fit it — ”
149587	149596	149598	149598	Harry	248	“ Trying to ruin someone else ’s life ? ”
149623	149626	149627	149627	she	333	“ Harry ! ”
149632	149645	149627	149627	she	333	“ How lovely ! Why do n’t you come and join — ? ”
149646	149660	149662	149662	Harry	248	“ I would n’t come near you with a ten - foot broomstick , ”
149665	149677	149662	149662	Harry	248	“ What did you do that to Hagrid for , eh ? ”
149686	149704	149681	149681	her	333	“ Our readers have a right to the truth , Harry . I am merely doing my — ”
149705	149715	149716	149716	Harry	248	“ Who cares if he ’s half - giant ? ”
149719	149727	149716	149716	Harry	248	“ There ’s nothing wrong with him ! ”
149799	149837	149779	149779	she	333	“ How about giving me an interview about the Hagrid you know , Harry ? The man behind the muscles ? Your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it . Would you call him a father substitute ? ”
149857	149862	149863	149863	she	333	“ You horrible woman , ”
149870	149897	149863	149863	she	333	“ you do n’t care , do you , anything for a story , and anyone will do , wo n’t they ? Even Ludo Bagman — ”
149898	149918	149924	149924	her	333	“ Sit down , you silly little girl , and do n’t talk about things you do n’t understand , ”
149933	149953	149954	149954	she	333	“ I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl … not that it needs it — ”
149963	149968	149970	149970	Hermione	186	“ Let ’s go , ”
149972	149980	149970	149970	Hermione	186	“ c’m on , Harry — Ron … ”
150028	150038	150040	150040	Ron	196	“ She ’ll be after you next , Hermione , ”
150056	150061	150066	150066	she	186	“ Let her try ! ”
150072	150101	150066	150066	she	186	“ I ’ll show her ! Silly little girl , am I ? Oh , I ’ll get her back for this . First Harry , then Hagrid … ”
150102	150113	150115	150115	Ron	196	“ You do n’t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter , ”
150118	150133	150115	150115	Ron	196	“ I ’m serious , Hermione , she ’ll dig up something on you — ”
150134	150152	150154	150154	Hermione	186	“ My parents do n’t read the Daily Prophet . She ca n’t scare me into hiding ! ”
150198	150223	150189	150189	she	186	“ And Hagrid is n’t hiding anymore ! He should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him ! Come on ! ”
150274	150277	150278	150278	Hermione	186	“ Hagrid ! ”
150287	150336	150278	150278	Hermione	186	“ Hagrid , that ’s enough ! We know you ’re in there ! Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess , Hagrid ! You ca n’t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you ! Hagrid , get out here , you ’re just being — ”
150344	150349	150341	150341	Hermione	186	“ About t — ! ”
150377	150381	150382	150382	he	195	“ Good afternoon , ”
150391	150402	150404	150404	Hermione	186	“ We — er — we wanted to see Hagrid , ”
150411	150419	150421	150421	Dumbledore	195	“ Yes , I surmised as much , ”
150427	150435	150423	150423	his	195	“ Why do n’t you come in ? ”
150436	150443	150445	150445	Hermione	186	“ Oh … um … okay , ”
150548	150553	150555	150555	Harry	248	“ Hi , Hagrid , ”
150561	150565	150566	150566	he	205	“ ’ Lo , ”
150574	150581	150583	150583	Dumbledore	195	“ More tea , I think , ”
150643	150658	150640	150640	Dumbledore	195	“ Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting , Hagrid ? ”
150672	150700	150665	150665	Dumbledore	195	“ Hermione , Harry , and Ron still seem to want to know you , judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door . ”
150701	150711	150712	150712	Harry	248	“ Of course we still want to know you ! ”
150719	150733	150734	150734	he	248	“ You do n’t think anything that Skeeter cow — sorry , Professor , ”
150742	150759	150761	150761	Dumbledore	195	“ I have gone temporarily deaf and have n’t any idea what you said , Harry , ”
150772	150777	150779	150779	Harry	248	“ Er — right , ”
150782	150805	150779	150779	Harry	248	“ I just meant — Hagrid , how could you think we ’d care what that — woman — wrote about you ? ”
150826	150839	150841	150841	Dumbledore	195	“ Living proof of what I ’ve been telling you , Hagrid , ”
150851	150892	150841	150841	Dumbledore	195	“ I have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here , telling me in no uncertain terms that if I sacked you , they would have something to say about it — ”
150893	150899	150901	150901	Hagrid	205	“ Not all of ’em , ”
150904	150915	150901	150901	Hagrid	205	“ Not all of ’em wan ’ me ter stay . ”
150916	150945	150947	150947	Dumbledore	195	“ Really , Hagrid , if you are holding out for universal popularity , I ’m afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time , ”
150959	151007	150947	150947	Dumbledore	195	“ Not a week has passed since I became headmaster of this school when I have n’t had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it . But what should I do ? Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody ? ”
151008	151017	151019	151019	Hagrid	205	“ Yeh — yeh’re not half - giant ! ”
151022	151033	151034	151034	Harry	248	“ Hagrid , look what I ’ve got for relatives ! ”
151038	151044	151034	151034	Harry	248	“ Look at the Dursleys ! ”
151045	151050	151052	151053	Professor Dumbledore	195	“ An excellent point , ”
151055	151124	151052	151053	Professor Dumbledore	195	“ My own brother , Aberforth , was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat . It was all over the papers , but did Aberforth hide ? No , he did not ! He held his head high and went about his business as usual ! Of course , I ’m not entirely sure he can read , so that may not have been bravery . … ”
151125	151133	151135	151135	Hermione	186	“ Come back and teach , Hagrid , ”
151138	151148	151135	151135	Hermione	186	“ please come back , we really miss you . ”

151193	151218	151190	151190	he	195	“ You will join me for breakfast at eight - thirty in the Great Hall . No excuses . Good afternoon to you all . ”

151296	151307	151294	151294	Ron	196	“ Can I have one of these cakes , Hagrid ? ”
151308	151312	151314	151314	Hagrid	205	“ Help yerself , ”
151326	151364	151323	151323	his	205	“ Ar , he ’s righ ’ , o ’ course — yeh’re all righ ’ … I bin stupid … my ol’ dad woulda bin ashamed o ’ the way I ’ve bin behavin ’ . … ”
151381	151397	151371	151371	he	205	“ Never shown you a picture of my old dad , have I ? Here … ”
151477	151490	151491	151491	Hagrid	205	“ Tha ’ was taken jus ’ after I got inter Hogwarts , ”
151494	151550	151491	151491	Hagrid	205	“ Dad was dead chuffed … thought I migh ’ not be a wizard , see , ’cos me mum … well , anyway . ’ Course , I never was great shakes at magic , really … but at least he never saw me expelled . Died , see , in me second year . …
151551	151752	151771	151774	Blast - Ended Skrewts	401	“ Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went . Got me the gamekeeper job … trusts people , he does . Gives ’em second chances … tha ’s what sets him apar ’ from other heads , see . He ’ll accept anyone at Hogwarts , s’long as they ’ve got the talent . Knows people can turn out okay even if their families weren ’ … well … all tha ’ respectable . But some don ’ understand that . There ’s some who ’d always hold it against yeh … there ’s some who ’d even pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an ’ say — I am what I am , an ’ I ’m not ashamed . ‘ Never be ashamed , ’ my ol’ dad used ter say , ‘ there ’s some who ’ll hold it against you , but they ’re not worth botherin ’ with . ’ An ’ he was right . I ’ve bin an idiot . I ’m not botherin ’ with her no more , I promise yeh that . Big bones … I ’ll give her big bones . ”
151807	151815	151816	151816	he	205	“ Yeh know wha ’ , Harry ? ”

153584	153605	153568	153568	Myrtle	489	“ Well … anyway … I ’d try the egg in the water . That ’s what Cedric Diggory did . ”

154192	154207	154188	154188	Harry	248	“ Myrtle … what lives in the lake , apart from the giant squid ? ”
154208	154213	154214	154214	she	489	“ Oh all sorts , ”
154217	154244	154214	154214	she	489	“ I sometimes go down there … sometimes do n’t have any choice , if someone flushes my toilet when I ’m not expecting it . … ”

154531	154539	154527	154527	Harry	248	“ how am I supposed to breathe ? ”
154552	154555	154556	154556	she	489	“ Tactless ! ”
154567	154572	154574	154574	Harry	248	“ What ’s tactless ? ”
154578	154587	154588	154588	she	489	“ Talking about breathing in front of me ! ”
154601	154616	154588	154588	she	489	“ When I ca n’t … when I have n’t … not for ages … ”

154663	154673	154659	154659	he	248	“ I did n’t mean — I just forgot … ”
154674	154686	154688	154688	Myrtle	489	“ Oh yes , very easy to forget Myrtle ’s dead , ”
154700	154808	154688	154688	Myrtle	489	“ Nobody missed me even when I was alive . Took them hours and hours to find my body — I know , I was sitting there waiting for them . Olive Hornby came into the bathroom — ‘ Are you in here again , sulking , Myrtle ? ’ she said , ‘ because Professor Dippet asked me to look for you — ’ And then she saw my body … ooooh , she did n’t forget it until her dying day , I made sure of that … followed her around and reminded her , I did . I remember at her brother ’s wedding — ”
154825	154835	154840	154840	they	3599	“ We ’ve taken what you ’ll sorely miss . ”
154863	154897	154858	154858	they	3599	“ — and then , of course , she went to the Ministry of Magic to stop me stalking her , so I had to come back here and live in my toilet . ”
154898	154901	154903	154903	Harry	248	“ Good , ”
154906	154933	154903	154903	Harry	248	“ Well , I ’m a lot further on than I was . … Shut your eyes again , will you ? I ’m getting out . ”
154961	154974	154975	154976	Moaning Myrtle	489	“ Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime ? ”
154987	154994	154995	154995	Harry	248	“ Er … I ’ll try , ”
155023	155034	154995	154995	Harry	248	“ See you , Myrtle … thanks for your help . ”

156171	156174	156176	156176	Snape	445	“ Peeves ? ”

156211	156216	156217	156217	Snape	445	“ Of course not , ”
156220	156227	156217	156217	Snape	445	“ I heard banging and wailing — ”
156228	156238	156150	156150	Filch	391	“ Yes , Professor , that was the egg — ”

156308	156323	156304	156304	Snape	445	“ I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break ! ”
156342	156358	156324	156324	Snape	445	“ I want you to come and help me search for the intruder , Filch . ”

156761	156770	156771	156771	he	344	“ Did I hear that correctly , Snape ? ”

156783	156788	156790	156790	Snape	368	“ It is unimportant , ”
156793	156798	156800	156800	Moody	344	“ On the contrary , ”
156802	156817	156800	156800	Moody	344	“ it is very important . Who ’d want to break into your office ? ”
156818	156825	156827	156827	Snape	368	“ A student , I daresay , ”
156842	156868	156800	156800	Moody	344	“ It has happened before . Potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard … students attempting illicit mixtures , no doubt . … ”
156869	156879	156881	156881	Moody	344	“ Reckon they were after potion ingredients , eh ? ”
156883	156895	156881	156881	Moody	344	“ Not hiding anything else in your office , are you ? ”
156920	156930	156931	156931	he	368	“ You know I ’m hiding nothing , Moody , ”
156940	156951	156931	156931	he	368	“ as you ’ve searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself . ”
156960	156975	156952	156952	Moody	344	“ Auror ’s privilege , Snape . Dumbledore told me to keep an eye — ”
156976	156983	156985	156985	Snape	368	“ Dumbledore happens to trust me , ”
156990	157005	156985	156985	Snape	368	“ I refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office ! ”
157006	157013	157015	157015	Moody	344	“ ’ Course Dumbledore trusts you , ”
157017	157061	157015	157015	Moody	344	“ He ’s a trusting man , is n’t he ? Believes in second chances . But me — I say there are spots that do n’t come off , Snape . Spots that never come off , d’you know what I mean ? ”
157092	157100	157089	157089	Moody	344	“ Get back to bed , Snape . ”
157101	157113	157114	157114	Snape	368	“ You do n’t have the authority to send me anywhere ! ”
157128	157144	157114	157114	Snape	368	“ I have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you do ! ”
157145	157149	157151	157151	Moody	344	“ Prowl away , ”
157161	157186	157154	157154	his	344	“ I look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time . … You ’ve dropped something , by the way . … ”

157274	157278	157257	157257	Snape	368	“ Accio Parchment ! ”
157304	157308	157309	157309	Moody	344	“ My mistake , ”
157313	157324	157309	157309	Moody	344	“ It ’s mine — must ’ve dropped it earlier — ”
157365	157368	157369	157369	he	344	“ Potter , ”
157373	157378	157380	157380	Moody	344	“ What ’s that ? ”
157391	157394	157395	157395	Snape	368	“ Potter ! ”
157422	157459	157416	157416	he	368	“ That egg is Potter ’s egg . That piece of parchment belongs to Potter . I have seen it before , I recognize it ! Potter is here ! Potter , in his Invisibility Cloak ! ”
157513	157521	157523	157523	Moody	344	“ There ’s nothing there , Snape ! ”
157525	157544	157523	157523	Moody	344	“ but I ’ll be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter ! ”
157545	157549	157550	157550	Snape	368	“ Meaning what ? ”
157569	157587	157589	157589	Moody	344	“ Meaning that Dumbledore ’s very interested to know who ’s got it in for that boy ! ”
157601	157613	157589	157589	Moody	344	“ And so am I , Snape … very interested . … ”
157677	157682	157684	157684	Snape	368	“ I merely thought , ”
157693	157724	157684	157684	Snape	368	“ that if Potter was wandering around after hours again … it ’s an unfortunate habit of his … he should be stopped . For — for his own safety . ”
157725	157731	157733	157733	Moody	344	“ Ah , I see , ”
157736	157748	157733	157733	Moody	344	“ Got Potter ’s best interests at heart , have you ? ”
157790	157800	157801	157801	Snape	368	“ I think I will go back to bed , ”
157805	157814	157816	157816	Moody	344	“ Best idea you ’ve had all night , ”
157818	157832	157816	157816	Moody	344	“ Now , Filch , if you ’ll just give me that egg — ”
157833	157836	157838	157838	Filch	391	“ No ! ”
157851	157863	157838	157838	Filch	391	“ Professor Moody , this is evidence of Peeves ’ treachery ! ”
157864	157877	157879	157879	Moody	394	“ It ’s the property of the champion he stole it from , ”
157881	157888	157879	157879	Moody	394	“ Hand it over , now . ”
157955	157979	157952	157953	Mrs. Norris	520	“ Never mind , my sweet … we ’ll see Dumbledore in the morning … tell him what Peeves was up to . … ”
158016	158022	158023	158023	he	394	“ Close shave , Potter , ”
158026	158035	158037	158037	Harry	162	“ Yeah … I — er … thanks , ”
158040	158046	158048	158048	Moody	394	“ What is this thing ? ”

158091	158096	158097	158097	Moody	394	“ Merlin ’s beard , ”
158111	158121	158097	158097	Moody	394	“ This … this is some map , Potter ! ”
158122	158131	158132	158132	Harry	162	“ Yeah , it ’s … quite useful , ”
158145	158159	158132	158132	Harry	162	“ Er — Professor Moody , d’you think you could help me — ? ”
158160	158172	158173	158173	Moody	394	“ What ? Oh ! Yes … yes , of course … ”
158210	158213	158214	158214	he	394	“ Potter … ”
158218	158247	158214	158214	he	394	“ you did n’t happen , by any chance , to see who broke into Snape ’s office , did you ? On this map , I mean ? ”
158248	158256	158257	158257	Harry	162	“ Er … yeah , I did … ”
158260	158266	158257	158257	Harry	162	“ It was Mr. Crouch . ”
158285	158288	158289	158289	he	394	“ Crouch ? ”
158292	158302	158289	158289	he	394	“ You ’re — you ’re sure , Potter ? ”
158303	158306	158308	158308	Harry	162	“ Positive , ”
158310	158319	158321	158321	Moody	394	“ Well , he ’s not here anymore , ”
158331	158342	158321	158321	Moody	394	“ Crouch … that ’s very — very interesting . … ”
158403	158422	158390	158390	Moody	394	“ Er … Professor Moody … why d’you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to look around Snape ’s office ? ”
158470	158478	158479	158479	Moody	394	“ Put it this way , Potter , ”
158483	158509	158479	158479	Moody	394	“ they say old Mad - Eye ’s obsessed with catching Dark wizards … but I ’m nothing — nothing — compared to Barty Crouch . ”
158525	158529	158530	158530	he	162	“ Professor Moody ? ”
158534	158557	158530	158530	he	162	“ D’you think … could this have anything to do with … maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there ’s something going on . … ”
158558	158562	158564	158564	Moody	394	“ Like what ? ”
158601	158607	158608	158608	Harry	248	“ I do n’t know , ”
158611	158647	158608	158608	Harry	248	“ odd stuff ’s been happening lately , has n’t it ? It ’s been in the Daily Prophet … the Dark Mark at the World Cup , and the Death Eaters and everything . … ”
158656	158665	158666	158666	he	394	“ You ’re a sharp boy , Potter , ”
158680	158689	158690	158690	he	394	“ Crouch could be thinking along those lines , ”
158694	158729	158690	158690	he	394	“ Very possible … there have been some funny rumors flying around lately — helped along by Rita Skeeter , of course . It ’s making a lot of people nervous , I reckon . ”
158738	158748	158749	158749	he	394	“ Oh if there ’s one thing I hate , ”
158775	158786	158749	158749	he	394	“ it ’s a Death Eater who walked free . … ”
158802	158815	158817	158817	Moody	394	“ And now I want to ask you a question , Potter , ”
158908	158914	158906	158906	himself	162	“ Can I borrow this ? ”
158915	158918	158920	158920	Harry	162	“ Oh ! ”
158963	158968	158957	158957	he	394	“ Yeah , okay . ”
158969	158973	158975	158975	Moody	394	“ Good boy , ”
158977	159010	158975	158975	Moody	394	“ I can make good use of this … this might be exactly what I ’ve been looking for . … Right , bed , Potter , come on , now . … ”
159063	159076	159055	159055	he	394	“ You ever thought of a career as an Auror , Potter ? ”
159077	159080	159082	159082	Harry	162	“ No , ”
159087	159094	159096	159096	Moody	394	“ You want to consider it , ”
159105	159128	159096	159096	Moody	394	“ Yes , indeed … and incidentally … I ’m guessing you were n’t just taking that egg for a walk tonight ? ”
159129	159134	159136	159136	Harry	162	“ Er — no , ”
159140	159149	159136	159136	Harry	162	“ I ’ve been working out the clue . ”
159162	159183	159184	159184	He	394	“ Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas , Potter . … See you in the morning . … ”
159337	159349	159351	159351	Hermione	186	“ You said you ’d already worked out that egg clue ! ”
159354	159360	159362	159362	Harry	162	“ Keep your voice down ! ”
159365	159381	159362	159362	Harry	162	“ I just need to — sort of fine - tune it , all right ? ”
159506	159518	159519	159519	Harry	162	“ Just forget the egg for a minute , all right ? ”
159538	159551	159522	159523	Professor Flitwick	365	“ I ’m trying to tell you about Snape and Moody . … ”
159596	159607	159608	159608	Ron	196	“ Snape said Moody ’s searched his office as well ? ”
159641	159660	159617	159617	he	196	“ What … d’you reckon Moody ’s here to keep an eye on Snape as well as Karkaroff ? ”
159661	159683	159685	159685	Harry	162	“ Well , I dunno if that ’s what Dumbledore asked him to do , but he ’s definitely doing it , ”
159710	159731	159688	159688	his	162	“ Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here because he ’s giving him a second chance or something . … ”
159732	159735	159737	159737	Ron	196	“ What ? ”
159765	159781	159761	159761	Flitwick	365	“ Harry … maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire ! ”
159782	159786	159791	159791	her	186	“ Oh Ron , ”
159795	159819	159791	159791	her	186	“ we thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before , and it turned out he was saving Harry ’s life , remember ? ”
159921	159930	159931	159931	Hermione	186	“ I do n’t care what Moody says , ”
159935	159980	159931	159931	Hermione	186	“ Dumbledore ’s not stupid . He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin , even though loads of people would n’t have given them jobs , so why should n’t he be right about Snape , even if Snape is a bit — ”
159981	159985	159987	159987	Ron	196	“ — evil , ”
159990	160009	159987	159987	Ron	196	“ Come on , Hermione , why are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his office , then ? ”
160010	160021	160023	160023	Hermione	186	“ Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill ? ”
160028	160068	160023	160023	Hermione	186	“ It ’s a bit funny , is n’t it , that he ca n’t manage to come to the Yule Ball , but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to ? ”
160069	160083	160085	160085	Ron	196	“ You just do n’t like Crouch because of that elf , Winky , ”
160095	160107	160109	160109	Hermione	186	“ You just want to think Snape ’s up to something , ”
160120	160142	160144	160144	Harry	248	“ I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance , if he ’s on his second one , ”
160350	160370	160371	160371	Hermione	186	“ Of course , the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something , ”
160374	160413	160371	160371	Hermione	186	“ If only we ’d done human Transfiguration already ! But I do n’t think we start that until sixth year , and it can go badly wrong if you do n’t know what you ’re doing . … ”
160414	160432	160434	160434	Harry	248	“ Yeah , I do n’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head , ”
160436	160457	160434	160434	Harry	248	“ I s’pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody ; he might do it for me . … ”
160458	160478	160480	160480	Hermione	186	“ I do n’t think he ’d let you choose what you wanted to be turned into , though , ”
160483	160497	160480	160480	Hermione	186	“ No , I think your best chance is some sort of charm . ”
160855	160860	160862	160862	Hermione	186	“ Weekend after next , ”
160874	160888	160862	160862	Hermione	186	“ Here — take my quill and send this owl back straight away . ”
160954	160968	160970	160970	Ron	196	“ What ’s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend for ? ”
160972	160975	160977	160977	Harry	248	“ Dunno , ”
160997	161006	160977	160977	Harry	248	“ Come on … Care of Magical Creatures . ”
161153	161161	161162	161162	Hagrid	205	“ Easier ter spot than the adults , ”
161167	161252	161162	161162	Hagrid	205	“ They turn silver when they ’re abou ’ two years old , an ’ they grow horns at aroun ’ four . Don ’ go pure white till they ’re full grown , ’ round about seven . They ’re a bit more trustin ’ when they ’re babies … don ’ mind boys so much . … C’m on , move in a bit , yeh can pat ’em if yeh want … give ’em a few o ’ these sugar lumps . …
161253	161259	161260	161260	Hagrid	205	“ You okay , Harry ? ”
161278	161281	161283	161283	Harry	248	“ Yeah , ”
161285	161292	161294	161294	Hagrid	205	“ Jus ’ nervous , eh ? ”
161296	161299	161301	161301	Harry	248	“ Bit , ”
161303	161306	161308	161308	Hagrid	205	“ Harry , ”
161328	161382	161308	161308	Hagrid	205	“ I ’d ’ve bin worried before I saw yeh take on tha ’ Horntail , but I know now yeh can do anythin ’ yeh set yer mind ter . I ’m not worried at all . Yeh’re goin’ ter be fine . Got yer clue worked out , haven ’ yeh ? ”
161457	161463	161464	161464	Hagrid	205	“ Yeh’re goin’ ter win , ”
161489	161506	161464	161464	Hagrid	205	“ I know it . I can feel it . Yeh’re goin’ ter win , Harry . ”
161702	161704	161749	161749	Ron	196	“ water ”
161717	161736	161749	161749	Ron	196	“ Take two pints of water , half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves , and a newt … ”
161737	161747	161749	161749	Ron	196	“ I do n’t reckon it can be done , ”
161761	161795	161749	161749	Ron	196	“ There ’s nothing . Nothing . Closest was that thing to dry up puddles and ponds , that Drought Charm , but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lake . ”
161796	161802	161803	161803	Hermione	186	“ There must be something , ”
161842	161854	161818	161818	she	186	“ They ’d never have set a task that was undoable . ”
161855	161859	161861	161861	Ron	196	“ They have , ”
161863	161908	161861	161861	Ron	196	“ Harry , just go down to the lake tomorrow , right , stick your head in , yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they ’ve nicked , and see if they chuck it out . Best you can do , mate . ”
161909	161918	161919	161919	Hermione	186	“ There ’s a way of doing it ! ”
161923	161930	161919	161919	Hermione	186	“ There just has to be ! ”
161958	161967	161969	161969	Harry	248	“ I know what I should have done , ”
161982	161994	161969	161969	Harry	248	“ I should ’ve learned to be an Animagus like Sirius . ”
162007	162022	162024	162024	Ron	196	“ Yeah , you could ’ve turned into a goldfish any time you wanted ! ”
162026	162031	162033	162033	Harry	248	“ Or a frog , ”
162039	162058	162060	162060	Hermione	186	“ It takes years to become an Animagus , and then you have to register yourself and everything , ”
162076	162115	162073	162073	Their	3694	“ Professor McGonagall told us , remember … you ’ve got to register yourself with the Improper Use of Magic Office … what animal you become , and your markings , so you ca n’t abuse it . … ”
162116	162123	162125	162125	Harry	248	“ Hermione , I was joking , ”
162128	162147	162125	162125	Harry	248	“ I know I have n’t got a chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morning . … ”
162148	162155	162156	162156	Hermione	186	“ Oh this is no use , ”
162165	162179	162156	162156	Hermione	186	“ Who on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringlets ? ”
162180	162186	162188	162189	Fred Weasley	200	“ I would n’t mind , ”
162193	162203	162188	162189	Fred Weasley	200	“ Be a talking point , would n’t it ? ”
162224	162232	162233	162233	Ron	196	“ What ’re you two doing here ? ”
162236	162241	162243	162243	George	201	“ Looking for you , ”
162245	162257	162243	162243	George	201	“ McGonagall wants you , Ron . And you , Hermione . ”
162258	162261	162263	162263	Hermione	186	“ Why ? ”
162268	162280	162282	162282	Fred	200	“ Dunno … she was looking a bit grim , though , ”
162284	162296	162298	162298	George	201	“ We ’re supposed to take you down to her office , ”
162349	162360	162361	162361	Hermione	186	“ We ’ll meet you back in the common room , ”
162380	162393	162365	162365	she	186	“ Bring as many of these books as you can , okay ? ”
162394	162397	162399	162399	Harry	248	“ Right , ”
162706	162725	162703	162704	Fleur Delacour	439	“ I knew it … ’ e is too young , ’ e is only a little boy . ”
162830	162833	162834	162834	Harry	248	“ Lumos , ”
163003	163009	163010	163010	she	3717	“ Come and get it ! ”
163014	163020	163010	163010	she	3717	“ Come on , jump ! ”
163021	163026	163027	163027	Harry	248	“ I ca n’t , ”
163041	163047	163027	163027	Harry	248	“ Give it to me ! ”
163068	163077	163049	163049	she	3717	“ That hurts — get off — ouch — ”
163078	163087	163049	163049	she	3717	“ Harry Potter must wake up , sir ! ”
163088	163093	163049	163049	she	3717	“ Stop poking me — ”

163196	163200	163201	163201	Harry	162	“ Ten minutes ? ”
163204	163210	163201	163201	Harry	162	“ Ten — ten minutes ? ”
163244	163250	163252	163252	Dobby	481	“ Hurry , Harry Potter ! ”

163338	163341	163343	163343	Harry	162	“ What ? ”
163345	163357	163343	163343	Harry	162	“ But you do n’t know what the second task is — ”
163358	163377	163316	163317	the elf	1327	“ Dobby knows , sir ! Harry Potter has to go into the lake and find his Wheezy — ”
163378	163383	163343	163343	Harry	162	“ Find my what ? ”
163384	163395	163316	163317	the elf	1327	“ — and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople ! ”
163396	163402	163343	163343	Harry	162	“ What ’s a Wheezy ? ”
163403	163420	163316	163317	the elf	1327	“ Your Wheezy , sir , your Wheezy — Wheezy who is giving Dobby his sweater ! ”
163436	163439	163440	163440	Harry	162	“ What ? ”
163443	163453	163440	163440	Harry	162	“ They ’ve got … they ’ve got Ron ? ”
163454	163465	163467	163467	Dobby	481	“ The thing Harry Potter will miss most , sir ! ”
163469	163477	163467	163467	Dobby	481	“ ‘ But past an hour — ’ ”
163478	163487	163488	163488	Harry	162	“ — ‘ the prospect ’s black , ’ ”
163501	163526	163488	163488	Harry	162	“ ‘ Too late , it ’s gone , it wo n’t come back . ’ Dobby — what ’ve I got to do ? ”
163527	163536	163538	163539	the elf	1327	“ You has to eat this , sir ! ”
163569	163582	163542	163542	he	1327	“ Right before you go into the lake , sir — gillyweed ! ”
163583	163589	163591	163591	Harry	162	“ What ’s it do ? ”
163598	163609	163542	163542	he	1327	“ It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater , sir ! ”
163610	163613	163615	163615	Harry	162	“ Dobby , ”
163618	163627	163615	163615	Harry	162	“ listen — are you sure about this ? ”

163798	163815	163789	163789	Dobby	481	“ Dobby will be missed — good luck , Harry Potter , sir , good luck ! ”

164333	164381	164321	164321	his	230	“ Well , all our champions are ready for the second task , which will start on my whistle . They have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them . On the count of three , then . One … two … three ! ”
165241	165244	165245	165245	Harry	248	“ Relashio ! ”

165545	165572	165540	165540	she	489	“ I wo n’t come with you . … I do n’t like them much , they always chase me when I get too close . … ”

166504	166511	166512	166512	Harry	248	“ She ’s my friend too ! ”
166529	166540	166512	166512	Harry	248	“ And I do n’t want them to die either ! ”

167688	167701	167702	167702	Harry	248	“ Fleur did n’t turn up , I could n’t leave her , ”
167705	167711	167713	167713	Ron	196	“ Harry , you prat , ”
167715	167738	167713	167713	Ron	196	“ you did n’t take that song thing seriously , did you ? Dumbledore would n’t have let any of us drown ! ”

167745	167760	167762	167762	Ron	196	“ It was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit ! ”
167764	167778	167762	167762	Ron	196	“ I hope you did n’t waste time down there acting the hero ! ”
167827	167831	167832	167832	Harry	248	“ C’m on , ”
167836	167852	167832	167832	Harry	248	“ help me with her , I do n’t think she can swim very well . ”

168084	168090	168092	168093	Madam Pomfrey	334	“ Come here , you , ”
168145	168151	168152	168152	Hermione	186	“ Harry , well done ! ”
168155	168168	168152	168152	Hermione	186	“ You did it , you found out how all by yourself ! ”
168169	168172	168174	168174	Harry	248	“ Well — ”
168229	168236	168238	168238	Harry	248	“ Yeah , that ’s right , ”
168251	168267	168269	168269	Krum	234	“ You haff a water beetle in your hair , Herm - own - ninny , ”
168309	168332	168300	168300	Hermione	186	“ You ’re well outside the time limit , though , Harry . … Did it take you ages to find us ? ”
168333	168342	168300	168300	Hermione	186	“ No … I found you okay . … ”
168495	168507	168482	168482	he	195	“ A conference before we give the marks , I think . ”
168588	168593	168594	168594	she	334	“ Look after Gabrielle , ”
168605	168611	168612	168612	she	334	“ You saved ’ er , ”
168616	168626	168612	168612	she	334	“ Even though she was not your ’ ostage . ”
168627	168630	168632	168632	Harry	248	“ Yeah , ”
168688	168697	168686	168686	Ron	196	“ And you too — you ’ elped — ”
168698	168701	168703	168703	Ron	196	“ Yeah , ”
168709	168715	168703	168703	Ron	196	“ yeah , a bit — ”
168763	168809	168735	168736	Ludo Bagman	230	“ Ladies and gentlemen , we have reached our decision . Merchieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake , and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions , as follows . …
168810	168851	168918	168918	Cho	268	“ Fleur Delacour , though she demonstrated excellent use of the Bubble - Head Charm , was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal , and failed to retrieve her hostage . We award her twenty - five points . ”
168857	168862	168868	168868	her	439	“ I deserved zero , ”
168872	168906	168910	168914	the Hufflepuffs in the crowd	3874	“ Cedric Diggory , who also used the Bubble - Head Charm , was first to return with his hostage , though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour . ”
168925	168935	168918	168918	Cho	268	“ We therefore award him forty - seven points . ”
168956	168986	168918	168918	Cho	268	“ Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration , which was nevertheless effective , and was second to return with his hostage . We award him forty points . ”
168996	169005	169006	169006	Bagman	230	“ Harry Potter used gillyweed to great effect , ”
169009	169064	169006	169006	Bagman	230	“ He returned last , and well outside the time limit of an hour . However , the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the hostages , and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety , not merely his own . ”
169080	169086	169090	169090	Bagman	230	“ Most of the judges , ”
169098	169122	169090	169090	Bagman	230	“ feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks . However … Mr. Potter ’s score is forty - five points . ”
169163	169170	169171	169171	Ron	196	“ There you go , Harry ! ”
169177	169192	169171	169171	Ron	196	“ You were n’t being thick after all — you were showing moral fiber ! ”
169228	169247	169249	169249	Bagman	230	“ The third and final task will take place at dusk on the twenty - fourth of June , ”
169251	169276	169249	169249	Bagman	230	“ The champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand . Thank you all for your support of the champions . ”
169526	169537	169538	169538	he	162	“ But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve , ”
169577	169591	169554	169554	he	196	“ I could ’ve taken those mer - idiots any time I wanted . ”
169592	169604	169606	169606	Hermione	186	“ What were you going to do , snore at them ? ”
169796	169805	169807	169807	Ron	196	“ He has n’t come back to Hogsmeade ? ”
169810	169820	169822	169822	Hermione	186	“ It looks like it , does n’t it ? ”
169824	169831	169833	169833	Harry	162	“ I ca n’t believe him , ”
169836	169842	169833	169833	Harry	162	“ if he ’s caught … ”
169843	169855	169857	169857	Ron	196	“ Made it so far , though , has n’t he ? ”
169859	169873	169857	169857	Ron	196	“ And it ’s not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore . ”
169987	169996	169997	169997	she	453	“ There they are , there they are ! ”
170049	170062	170063	170063	Pansy	453	“ You might find something to interest you in there , Granger ! ”
170355	170365	170324	170324	Krum	234	“ never felt this way about any other girl . ”
170387	170393	170395	170396	Pansy Parkinson	453	“ She ’s really ugly , ”
170407	170435	170395	170396	Pansy Parkinson	453	“ but she ’d be well up to making a Love Potion , she ’s quite brainy . I think that ’s how she ’s doing it . ”
170485	170490	170491	170491	Ron	196	“ I told you ! ”
170503	170528	170491	170491	Ron	196	“ I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter ! She ’s made you out to be some sort of — of scarlet woman ! ”
170538	170542	170543	170543	she	186	“ Scarlet woman ? ”
170557	170566	170567	170567	Ron	196	“ It ’s what my mum calls them , ”
170575	170591	170599	170599	she	186	“ If that ’s the best Rita can do , she ’s losing her touch , ”
170610	170618	170599	170599	she	186	“ What a pile of old rubbish . ”
170679	170687	170689	170689	Hermione	186	“ There ’s something funny , though , ”
170705	170714	170689	170689	Hermione	186	“ How could Rita Skeeter have known … ? ”
170715	170719	170721	170721	Ron	196	“ Known what ? ”
170724	170737	170721	170721	Ron	196	“ You have n’t been mixing up Love Potions , have you ? ”
170738	170744	170745	170745	Hermione	186	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
170756	170777	170752	170752	her	186	“ No , it ’s just … how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer ? ”
170792	170795	170797	170797	Ron	196	“ What ? ”
170807	170822	170823	170823	Hermione	186	“ He asked me right after he ’d pulled me out of the lake , ”
170826	170880	170823	170823	Hermione	186	“ After he ’d got rid of his shark ’s head . Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they would n’t hear , and he said , if I was n’t doing anything over the summer , would I like to — ”
170881	170888	170890	170890	Ron	196	“ And what did you say ? ”
170921	170937	170938	170938	Hermione	186	“ And he did say he ’d never felt the same way about anyone else , ”
170957	170997	170955	170955	her	186	“ but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him ? She was n’t there … or was she ? Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak ; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task . … ”
170998	171005	171006	171006	Ron	196	“ And what did you say ? ”
171021	171037	171006	171006	Ron	196	“ Well , I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to — ”
171038	171050	170955	170955	her	186	“ Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is , Miss Granger , ”
171066	171084	171060	171063	all three of them	1587	“ I must ask you not to discuss it in my class . Ten points from Gryffindor . ”
171121	171132	171133	171133	Snape	368	“ Ah … reading magazines under the table as well ? ”
171144	171157	171133	171133	Snape	368	“ A further ten points from Gryffindor … oh but of course … ”
171172	171184	171158	171158	Snape	368	“ Potter has to keep up with his press cuttings . … ”
171217	171247	171209	171209	he	368	“ ‘ Harry Potter ’s Secret Heartache … dear , dear , Potter , what ’s ailing you now ? ‘ A boy like no other , perhaps … ’ ”
171290	171320	171322	171322	Snape	368	“ ‘ … Harry Potter ’s well - wishers must hope that , next time , he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate . ’ How very touching , ”
171337	171398	171322	171322	Snape	368	“ Well , I think I had better separate the three of you , so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives . Weasley , you stay here . Miss Granger , over there , beside Miss Parkinson . Potter — that table in front of my desk . Move . Now . ”
171466	171484	171486	171486	Snape	368	“ All this press attention seems to have inflated your already over - large head , Potter , ”
171543	171561	171562	171562	Snape	368	“ You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you , ”
171598	171635	171574	171574	him	368	“ but I do n’t care how many times your picture appears in the papers . To me , Potter , you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him . ”
171681	171691	171692	171692	Snape	368	“ So I give you fair warning , Potter , ”
171702	171722	171692	171692	Snape	368	“ pint - sized celebrity or not — if I catch you breaking into my office one more time — ”
171723	171733	171735	171735	Harry	162	“ I have n’t been anywhere near your office ! ”
171743	171750	171751	171751	Snape	368	“ Do n’t lie to me , ”
171763	171783	171751	171751	Snape	368	“ Boomslang skin . Gillyweed . Both come from my private stores , and I know who stole them . ”
171863	171874	171875	171875	Harry	162	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about , ”
171879	171894	171895	171895	Snape	368	“ You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into ! ”
171898	171940	171895	171895	Snape	368	“ I know it , Potter ! Now , Mad - Eye Moody might have joined your fan club , but I will not tolerate your behavior ! One more nighttime stroll into my office , Potter , and you will pay !
171941	171944	171946	171946	Harry	162	“ Right , ”
171956	171974	171946	171946	Harry	162	“ I ’ll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there . ”
172034	172044	172045	172045	Snape	368	“ Do you know what this is , Potter ? ”
172054	172057	172059	172059	Harry	162	“ No , ”
172067	172094	172096	172096	Snape	368	“ It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear , ”
172099	172130	172132	172132	he	368	“ Now , the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines . But unless you watch your step , you might just find that my hand slips ”
172139	172167	172132	172132	he	368	“ right over your evening pumpkin juice . And then , Potter … then we ’ll find out whether you ’ve been in my office or not . ”
172338	172341	172343	172343	Snape	368	“ Enter , ”
172387	172393	172395	172395	Karkaroff	430	“ We need to talk , ”
172446	172458	172459	172459	Snape	368	“ I ’ll talk to you after my lesson , Karkaroff , ”
172467	172489	172463	172463	Karkaroff	430	“ I want to talk now , while you ca n’t slip off , Severus . You ’ve been avoiding me . ”
172490	172495	172496	172496	Snape	368	“ After the lesson , ”
172622	172628	172631	172631	Snape	368	“ What ’s so urgent ? ”
172636	172639	172641	172641	Karkaroff	430	“ This , ”
172675	172678	172680	172680	Karkaroff	430	“ Well ? ”
172692	172707	172680	172680	Karkaroff	430	“ Do you see ? It ’s never been this clear , never since — ”
172708	172713	172715	172715	Snape	368	“ Put it away ! ”
172724	172731	172732	172732	Karkaroff	430	“ But you must have noticed — ”
172739	172747	172749	172749	Snape	368	“ We can talk later , Karkaroff ! ”
172751	172759	172749	172749	Snape	368	“ Potter ! What are you doing ? ”
172760	172769	172771	172771	Harry	162	“ Clearing up my armadillo bile , Professor , ”
173114	173119	173121	173121	Harry	162	“ Hello , Sirius , ”
173470	173473	173474	173474	he	202	“ Chicken ! ”
173511	173514	173516	173516	Sirius	202	“ Thanks , ”
173542	173567	173539	173539	his	202	“ I ’ve been living off rats mostly . Ca n’t steal too much food from Hogsmeade ; I ’d draw attention to myself . ”
173582	173591	173592	173592	he	162	“ What ’re you doing here , Sirius ? ”
173595	173602	173604	173604	Sirius	202	“ Fulfilling my duty as godfather , ”
173617	173633	173604	173604	Sirius	202	“ Do n’t worry about it , I ’m pretending to be a lovable stray . ”
173652	173707	173634	173634	He	202	“ I want to be on the spot . Your last letter … well , let ’s just say things are getting fishier . I ’ve been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out , and by the looks of things , I ’m not the only one who ’s getting worried . ”
173739	173752	173708	173708	He	202	“ What if they catch you ? What if you ’re seen ? ”
173753	173771	173773	173773	Sirius	202	“ You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I ’m an Animagus , ”
173873	173884	173886	173886	Harry	162	“ They ’re making it sound like he ’s dying , ”
173889	173906	173886	173886	Harry	162	“ But he ca n’t be that ill if he managed to get up here . … ”
173907	173916	173917	173917	Ron	196	“ My brother ’s Crouch ’s personal assistant , ”
173921	173930	173917	173917	Ron	196	“ He says Crouch is suffering from overwork . ”
173931	173948	173950	173950	Harry	162	“ Mind you , he did look ill , last time I saw him up close , ”
173958	173970	173950	173950	Harry	162	“ The night my name came out of the goblet . … ”
173971	173983	173990	173990	her	186	“ Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky , is n’t he ? ”
174007	174034	173996	173996	Buckbeak	203	“ I bet he wishes he had n’t done it now — bet he feels the difference now she ’s not there to look after him . ”
174035	174044	174045	174045	Ron	196	“ Hermione ’s obsessed with house - elfs , ”
174063	174071	174056	174056	Sirius	202	“ Crouch sacked his house - elf ? ”
174072	174081	174083	174083	Harry	162	“ Yeah , at the Quidditch World Cup , ”
174138	174145	174146	174146	he	202	“ Let me get this straight , ”
174158	174178	174146	174146	he	202	“ You first saw the elf in the Top Box . She was saving Crouch a seat , right ? ”
174179	174182	174184	174184	Harry	162	“ Right , ”
174192	174203	174146	174146	he	202	“ But Crouch did n’t turn up for the match ? ”
174204	174207	174209	174209	Harry	162	“ No , ”
174211	174222	174209	174209	Harry	162	“ I think he said he ’d been too busy . ”
174236	174255	174233	174233	he	202	“ Harry , did you check your pockets for your wand after you ’d left the Top Box ? ”
174256	174259	174260	174260	Harry	162	“ Erm … ”
174264	174267	174268	174268	he	162	“ No , ”
174272	174307	174308	174308	He	162	“ I did n’t need to use it before we got in the forest . And then I put my hand in my pocket , and all that was in there were my Omnioculars . ”
174313	174329	174308	174308	He	162	“ Are you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box ? ”
174330	174335	174337	174337	Sirius	202	“ It ’s possible , ”
174339	174347	174348	174348	Hermione	186	“ Winky did n’t steal that wand ! ”
174351	174363	174365	174365	Sirius	202	“ The elf was n’t the only one in that box , ”
174376	174384	174371	174371	he	202	“ Who else was sitting behind you ? ”
174385	174390	174392	174392	Harry	162	“ Loads of people , ”
174394	174405	174392	174392	Harry	162	“ Some Bulgarian ministers … Cornelius Fudge … the Malfoys … ”
174406	174410	174412	174412	Ron	196	“ The Malfoys ! ”
174433	174441	174429	174429	his	203	“ I bet it was Lucius Malfoy ! ”
174442	174446	174448	174448	Sirius	202	“ Anyone else ? ”
174450	174454	174456	174456	Harry	162	“ No one , ”
174458	174469	174472	174472	him	162	“ Yes , there was , there was Ludo Bagman , ”
174474	174478	174470	174470	Hermione	186	“ Oh yeah … ”
174479	174499	174501	174501	Sirius	202	“ I do n’t know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps , ”
174506	174512	174501	174501	Sirius	202	“ What ’s he like ? ”
174513	174518	174520	174520	Harry	162	“ He ’s okay , ”
174522	174534	174520	174520	Harry	162	“ He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament . ”
174535	174541	174543	174543	Sirius	202	“ Does he , now ? ”
174549	174558	174543	174543	Sirius	202	“ I wonder why he ’d do that ? ”
174559	174569	174571	174571	Harry	162	“ Says he ’s taken a liking to me , ”
174573	174576	174578	174578	Sirius	202	“ Hmm , ”
174583	174597	174600	174600	Sirius	202	“ We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared , ”
174602	174605	174606	174606	she	186	“ Remember ? ”
174613	174628	174630	174630	Ron	196	“ Yeah , but he did n’t stay in the forest , did he ? ”
174632	174649	174630	174630	Ron	196	“ The moment we told him about the riot , he went off to the campsite . ”
174650	174655	174656	174656	Hermione	186	“ How d’you know ? ”
174660	174669	174656	174656	Hermione	186	“ How d’you know where he Disapparated to ? ”
174670	174675	174677	174677	Ron	196	“ Come off it , ”
174680	174693	174677	174677	Ron	196	“ Are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark ? ”
174694	174705	174707	174707	Hermione	186	“ It ’s more likely he did it than Winky , ”
174710	174714	174716	174716	Ron	196	“ Told you , ”
174723	174732	174716	174716	Ron	196	“ told you she ’s obsessed with house — ”
174743	174768	174734	174734	Sirius	202	“ When the Dark Mark had been conjured , and the elf had been discovered holding Harry ’s wand , what did Crouch do ? ”
174769	174777	174779	174779	Harry	162	“ Went to look in the bushes , ”
174781	174790	174779	174779	Harry	162	“ but there was n’t anyone else there . ”
174791	174795	174796	174796	Sirius	202	“ Of course , ”
174804	174827	174796	174796	Sirius	202	“ of course , he ’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf … and then he sacked her ? ”
174828	174831	174833	174833	Hermione	186	“ Yes , ”
174839	174859	174833	174833	Hermione	186	“ he sacked her , just because she had n’t stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled — ”
174860	174873	174875	174875	Ron	196	“ Hermione , will you give it a rest with the elf ! ”
174884	174925	174879	174879	his	202	“ She ’s got the measure of Crouch better than you have , Ron . If you want to know what a man ’s like , take a good look at how he treats his inferiors , not his equals . ”
174939	175025	174926	174926	He	202	“ All these absences of Barty Crouch ’s … he goes to the trouble of making sure his house - elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup , but does n’t bother to turn up and watch . He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament , and then stops coming to that too . … It ’s not like Crouch . If he ’s ever taken a day off work because of illness before this , I ’ll eat Buckbeak . ”
175026	175033	175035	175035	Harry	162	“ D’you know Crouch , then ? ”
175070	175078	175079	175079	he	202	“ Oh I know Crouch all right , ”
175083	175104	175079	175079	he	202	“ He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a trial . ”
175105	175108	175110	175110	Ron	196	“ What ? ”
175115	175120	175122	175122	Harry	162	“ You ’re kidding ! ”
175124	175131	175133	175133	Sirius	202	“ No , I ’m not , ”
175142	175161	175133	175133	Sirius	202	“ Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement , did n’t you know ? ”
175172	175183	175185	175185	Sirius	202	“ He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic , ”
175187	175211	175212	175212	he	196	“ He ’s a great wizard , Barty Crouch , powerfully magical — and power - hungry . Oh never a Voldemort supporter , ”
175223	175263	175212	175212	he	196	“ No , Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side . But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side … well , you would n’t understand … you ’re too young . … ”
175264	175276	175278	175278	Ron	196	“ That ’s what my dad said at the World Cup , ”
175289	175298	175286	175286	his	196	“ Try us , why do n’t you ? ”
175308	175318	175319	175319	He	196	“ All right , I ’ll try you . … ”
175333	175461	175319	175319	He	196	“ Imagine that Voldemort ’s powerful now . You do n’t know who his supporters are , you do n’t know who ’s working for him and who is n’t ; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves . You ’re scared for yourself , and your family , and your friends . Every week , news comes of more deaths , more disappearances , more torturing … the Ministry of Magic ’s in disarray , they do n’t know what to do , they ’re trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles , but meanwhile , Muggles are dying too . Terror everywhere … panic … confusion … that ’s how it used to be .
175462	175651	175652	175652	Sirius	202	“ Well , times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others . Crouch ’s principles might ’ve been good in the beginning — I would n’t know . He rose quickly through the Ministry , and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemort ’s supporters . The Aurors were given new powers — powers to kill rather than capture , for instance . And I was n’t the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial . Crouch fought violence with violence , and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects . I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side . He had his supporters , mind you — plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way , and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic . When Voldemort disappeared , it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job . But then something rather unfortunate happened . … ”
175656	175693	175652	175652	Sirius	202	“ Crouch ’s own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who ’d managed to talk their way out of Azkaban . Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power . ”
175694	175701	175703	175703	Hermione	186	“ Crouch ’s son was caught ? ”
175705	175708	175710	175710	Sirius	202	“ Yep , ”
175738	175786	175720	175720	himself	202	“ Nasty little shock for old Barty , I ’d imagine . Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family , should n’t he ? Ought to have left the office early once in a while … gotten to know his own son . ”
175797	175805	175807	175807	Harry	162	“ Was his son a Death Eater ? ”
175809	175813	175815	175815	Sirius	202	“ No idea , ”
175822	175887	175815	175815	Sirius	202	“ I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in . This is mostly stuff I ’ve found out since I got out . The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I ’d bet my life were Death Eaters — but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time , just like the house - elf . ”
175888	175898	175899	175899	Hermione	186	“ Did Crouch try and get his son off ? ”
175915	176032	175902	175902	Sirius	202	“ Crouch let his son off ? I thought you had the measure of him , Hermione ! Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go ; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic . You saw him dismiss a devoted house - elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again — does n’t that tell you what he ’s like ? Crouch ’s fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial , and by all accounts , it was n’t much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy … then he sent him straight to Azkaban . ”
176033	176043	176045	176045	Harry	162	“ He gave his own son to the dementors ? ”
176048	176053	176055	176055	Sirius	202	“ That ’s right , ”
176066	176139	176058	176058	he	202	“ I saw the dementors bringing him in , watched them through the bars in my cell door . He ca n’t have been more than nineteen . They took him into a cell near mine . He was screaming for his mother by nightfall . He went quiet after a few days , though … they all went quiet in the end … except when they shrieked in their sleep . … ”
176165	176173	176174	176174	Harry	162	“ So he ’s still in Azkaban ? ”
176177	176180	176182	176182	Sirius	202	“ No , ”
176185	176206	176182	176182	Sirius	202	“ No , he ’s not in there anymore . He died about a year after they brought him in . ”
176207	176211	176354	176354	Sirius	202	“ He died ? ”
176212	176220	176222	176222	Sirius	202	“ He was n’t the only one , ”
176225	176353	176222	176222	Sirius	202	“ Most go mad in there , and plenty stop eating in the end . They lose the will to live . You could always tell when a death was coming , because the dementors could sense it , they got excited . That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived . Crouch being an important Ministry member , he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit . That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch , half carrying his wife past my cell . She died herself , apparently , shortly afterward . Grief . Wasted away just like the boy . Crouch never came for his son ’s body . The dementors buried him outside the fortress ; I watched them do it . ”
176379	176396	176397	176397	he	202	“ So old Crouch lost it all , just when he thought he had it made , ”
176410	176522	176397	176397	he	202	“ One moment , a hero , poised to become Minister of Magic … next , his son dead , his wife dead , the family name dishonored , and , so I ’ve heard since I escaped , a big drop in popularity . Once the boy had died , people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray . The conclusion was that his father never cared much for him . So Cornelius Fudge got the top job , and Crouch was shunted sideways into the Department of International Magical Cooperation . ”
176604	176615	176616	176616	Harry	162	“ Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards , ”
176620	176637	176639	176639	Sirius	202	“ Yeah , I ’ve heard it ’s become a bit of a mania with him , ”
176643	176666	176639	176639	Sirius	202	“ If you ask me , he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater . ”
176667	176679	176681	176681	Ron	196	“ And he sneaked up here to search Snape ’s office ! ”
176688	176700	176702	176702	Sirius	202	“ Yes , and that does n’t make sense at all , ”
176704	176710	176712	176712	Ron	196	“ Yeah , it does ! ”
176721	176761	176718	176718	his	202	“ Listen , if Crouch wants to investigate Snape , why has n’t he been coming to judge the tournament ? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him . ”
176762	176775	176777	176777	Harry	162	“ So you think Snape could be up to something , then ? ”
176784	176799	176718	176718	his	202	“ Look , I do n’t care what you say , Dumbledore trusts Snape — ”
176800	176809	176811	176811	Ron	196	“ Oh give it a rest , Hermione , ”
176814	176838	176811	176811	Ron	196	“ I know Dumbledore ’s brilliant and everything , but that does n’t mean a really clever Dark wizard could n’t fool him — ”
176839	176863	176718	176718	his	202	“ Why did Snape save Harry ’s life in the first year , then ? Why did n’t he just let him die ? ”
176864	176877	176811	176811	Ron	196	“ I dunno — maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out — ”
176878	176885	176886	176886	Harry	162	“ What d’you think , Sirius ? ”
176899	176909	176911	176911	Sirius	202	“ I think they ’ve both got a point , ”
176920	176969	176970	176970	Sirius	202	“ Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here , I ’ve wondered why Dumbledore hired him . Snape ’s always been fascinated by the Dark Arts , he was famous for it at school . Slimy , oily , greasy - haired kid , he was , ”
176982	177019	176976	176976	Ron	196	“ Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year , and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters . ”
177031	177139	177020	177020	Sirius	202	“ Rosier and Wilkes — they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell . The Lestranges — they ’re a married couple — they ’re in Azkaban . Avery — from what I ’ve heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he ’d been acting under the Imperius Curse — he ’s still at large . But as far as I know , Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater — not that that means much . Plenty of them were never caught . And Snape ’s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble . ”
177140	177155	177157	177157	Ron	196	“ Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well , but he wants to keep that quiet , ”
177159	177177	177179	177179	Harry	162	“ Yeah , you should ’ve seen Snape ’s face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday ! ”
177182	177220	177179	177179	Harry	162	“ Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape , he says Snape ’s been avoiding him . Karkaroff looked really worried . He showed Snape something on his arm , but I could n’t see what it was . ”
177221	177230	177232	177232	Sirius	202	“ He showed Snape something on his arm ? ”
177252	177280	177238	177238	He	202	“ Well , I ’ve no idea what that ’s about … but if Karkaroff ’s genuinely worried , and he ’s going to Snape for answers … ”
177295	177340	177281	177281	Sirius	202	“ There ’s still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape , and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people would n’t , but I just ca n’t see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he ’d ever worked for Voldemort . ”
177341	177357	177359	177359	Ron	196	“ Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snape ’s office then ? ”
177362	177365	177367	177367	Sirius	202	“ Well , ”
177370	177553	177367	177367	Sirius	202	“ I would n’t put it past Mad - Eye to have searched every single teacher ’s office when he got to Hogwarts . He takes his Defense Against the Dark Arts seriously , Moody . I ’m not sure he trusts anyone at all , and after the things he ’s seen , it ’s not surprising . I ’ll say this for Moody , though , he never killed if he could help it . Always brought people in alive where possible . He was tough , but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters . Crouch , though … he ’s a different matter … is he really ill ? If he is , why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape ’s office ? And if he ’s not … what ’s he up to ? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he did n’t turn up in the Top Box ? What ’s he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament ? ”
177591	177615	177585	177585	Sirius	202	“ You say your brother ’s Crouch ’s personal assistant ? Any chance you could ask him if he ’s seen Crouch lately ? ”
177616	177621	177623	177623	Ron	196	“ I can try , ”
177626	177648	177623	177623	Ron	196	“ Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy , though . Percy loves Crouch . ”
177649	177672	177674	177674	Sirius	202	“ And you might try and find out whether they ’ve got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you ’re at it , ”
177686	177694	177696	177696	Harry	162	“ Bagman told me they had n’t , ”
177698	177710	177712	177712	Sirius	202	“ Yes , he ’s quoted in the article in there , ”
177719	177825	177712	177712	Sirius	202	“ Blustering on about how bad Bertha ’s memory is . Well , maybe she ’s changed since I knew her , but the Bertha I knew was n’t forgetful at all — quite the reverse . She was a bit dim , but she had an excellent memory for gossip . It used to get her into a lot of trouble ; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut . I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic … maybe that ’s why Bagman did n’t bother to look for her for so long . … ”
177837	177843	177901	177901	He	202	“ What ’s the time ? ”
177867	177874	177876	177876	Hermione	186	“ It ’s half past three , ”
177878	177887	177888	177888	Sirius	202	“ You ’d better get back to school , ”
177896	177900	177888	177888	Sirius	202	“ Now listen … ”
177908	177965	177901	177901	He	202	“ I do n’t want you lot sneaking out of school to see me , all right ? Just send notes to me here . I still want to hear about anything odd . But you ’re not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission ; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you . ”
177966	177986	177987	177987	Harry	162	“ No one ’s tried to attack me so far , except a dragon and a couple of grindylows , ”
177996	178040	178041	178041	He	202	“ I do n’t care … I ’ll breathe freely again when this tournament ’s over , and that ’s not until June . And do n’t forget , if you ’re talking about me among yourselves , call me Snuffles , okay ? ”
178058	178071	178073	178073	Sirius	202	“ I ’ll walk to the edge of the village with you , ”
178075	178084	178073	178073	Sirius	202	“ see if I can scrounge another paper . ”
178166	178177	178178	178178	Ron	196	“ Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch ? ”
178190	178230	178178	178178	Ron	196	“ But maybe he does n’t care … it ’d probably just make him admire Crouch even more . Yeah , Percy loves rules . He ’d just say Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son . ”
178231	178244	178246	178246	Hermione	186	“ Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors , ”
178249	178255	178257	178257	Ron	196	“ I do n’t know , ”
178259	178282	178257	178257	Ron	196	“ If he thought we were standing in the way of his career … Percy ’s really ambitious , you know . … ”
178308	178313	178315	178315	Ron	196	“ Poor old Snuffles , ”
178320	178337	178315	178315	Ron	196	“ He must really like you , Harry . … Imagine having to live off rats . ”
178454	178463	178464	178464	he	481	“ Harry Potter is too good to Dobby ! ”
178476	178491	178493	178493	Harry	162	“ You saved my life with that gillyweed , Dobby , you really did , ”
178495	178507	178509	178509	Ron	196	“ No chance of more of those eclairs , is there ? ”
178524	178531	178533	178533	Hermione	186	“ You ’ve just had breakfast ! ”
178554	178566	178567	178567	Harry	162	“ We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles , ”
178570	178574	178576	178576	Ron	196	“ Good idea , ”
178578	178599	178600	178600	he	196	“ Give Pig something to do . You could n’t give us a bit of extra food , could you ? ”
178619	178626	178628	178628	Hermione	186	“ Dobby , where ’s Winky ? ”
178635	178646	178648	178648	Dobby	481	“ Winky is over there by the fire , miss , ”
178656	178660	178664	178664	she	186	“ Oh dear , ”
178748	178759	178760	178760	Dobby	481	“ Winky is getting through six bottles a day now , ”
178765	178776	178777	178777	Harry	162	“ Well , it ’s not strong , that stuff , ”
178786	178798	178799	178799	he	481	“ ’ Tis strong for a house - elf , sir , ”
178823	178831	178832	178832	Dobby	481	“ Winky is pining , Harry Potter , ”
178836	178869	178832	178832	Dobby	481	“ Winky wants to go home . Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is her master , sir , and nothing Dobby says will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is her master now . ”
178870	178875	178877	178877	Harry	248	“ Hey , Winky , ”
178894	178922	178877	178877	Harry	248	“ you do n’t know what Mr. Crouch might be up to , do you ? Because he ’s stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament . ”
178943	178954	178935	178935	She	286	“ M — Master is stopped — hic — coming ? ”
178955	178958	178960	178960	Harry	248	“ Yeah , ”
178962	178982	178960	178960	Harry	248	“ we have n’t seen him since the first task . The Daily Prophet ’s saying he ’s ill . ”

179008	179019	179021	179021	Hermione	186	“ But we ’re not sure if that ’s true , ”

179039	179055	179036	179037	the elf	1327	“ Master can not — hic — manage — hic — all by himself . … ”
179056	179071	179072	179072	Hermione	186	“ Other people manage to do their own housework , you know , Winky , ”
179076	179093	179094	179094	Winky	286	“ Winky — hic — is not only — hic — doing housework for Mr. Crouch ! ”
179112	179134	179094	179094	Winky	286	“ Master is — hic — trusting Winky with — hic — the most important — hic — the most secret — ”
179135	179138	179140	179140	Harry	248	“ What ? ”

179484	179534	179481	179481	Hermione	186	“ Listen to me , all of you ! You ’ve got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy ! You ’ve got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes , you do n’t have to do everything you ’re told — look at Dobby ! ”
179535	179545	179546	179546	Dobby	481	“ Miss will please keep Dobby out of this , ”

180165	180189	180163	180163	Hermione	186	“ I ’ve taken out a subscription to the Daily Prophet . I ’m getting sick of finding everything out from the Slytherins . ”
180190	180194	180196	180196	Harry	248	“ Good thinking ! ”

182659	182732	182616	182616	Hermione	186	“ All those substitutes for magic Muggles use — electricity , computers , and radar , and all those things — they all go haywire around Hogwarts , there ’s too much magic in the air . No , Rita ’s using magic to eavesdrop , she must be . … If I could just find out what it is … ooh , if it ’s illegal , I ’ll have her … ”

183837	183874	183830	183830	Bagman	230	“ Then Mr. Krum will enter … then Miss Delacour . But you ’ll all be in with a fighting chance , depending how well you get past the obstacles . Should be fun , eh ? ”

187007	187016	187018	187018	Hagrid	205	“ Oh yeah … right y’are , Professor … ”
187035	187045	187046	187046	Dumbledore	195	“ I do n’t know where Barty Crouch is , ”
187050	187060	187046	187046	Dumbledore	195	“ but it is essential that we find him . ”
187061	187067	187069	187069	Moody	394	“ I ’m onto it , ”
187124	187129	187130	187130	he	430	“ What is this ? ”
187146	187152	187142	187142	Harry	248	“ What ’s going on ? ”
187153	187158	187160	187160	Krum	234	“ I vos attacked ! ”
187170	187178	187160	187160	Krum	234	“ Mr. Crouch or votever his name — ”
187179	187192	187142	187142	Harry	248	“ Crouch attacked you ? Crouch attacked you ? The Triwizard judge ? ”
187193	187196	187197	187197	Dumbledore	195	“ Igor , ”
187216	187219	187220	187220	he	430	“ Treachery ! ”
187227	187330	187220	187220	he	430	“ It is a plot ! You and your Ministry of Magic have lured me here under false pretenses , Dumbledore ! This is not an equal competition ! First you sneak Potter into the tournament , though he is underage ! Now one of your Ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of action ! I smell double - dealing and corruption in this whole affair , and you , Dumbledore , you , with your talk of closer international wizarding links , of rebuilding old ties , of forgetting old differences — here ’s what I think of you ! ”
187369	187372	187373	187373	Hagrid	205	“ Apologize ! ”
187395	187400	187401	187401	Dumbledore	195	“ Hagrid , no ! ”
187447	187459	187461	187461	Dumbledore	195	“ Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle , Hagrid , ”
187474	187485	187467	187467	Hagrid	205	“ Maybe I ’d better stay here , Headmaster . … ”
187486	187497	187498	187498	Dumbledore	195	“ You will take Harry back to school , Hagrid , ”
187502	187547	187498	187498	Dumbledore	195	“ Take him right up to Gryffindor Tower . And Harry — I want you to stay there . Anything you might want to do — any owls you might want to send — they can wait until morning , do you understand me ? ”
187548	187553	187555	187555	Harry	162	“ Er — yes , ”
187590	187600	187601	187601	Hagrid	205	“ I ’ll leave Fang with yeh , Headmaster , ”
187627	187637	187607	187607	Karkaroff	430	“ Stay , Fang . C’m on , Harry . ”
187652	187657	187658	187658	Hagrid	205	“ How dare he , ”
187667	187715	187716	187716	Hagrid	205	“ How dare he accuse Dumbledore . Like Dumbledore’d do anythin ’ like that . Like Dumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the firs ’ place . Worried ! I dunno when I seen Dumbledore more worried than he ’s bin lately . An ’ you ! ”
187732	187781	187716	187716	Hagrid	205	“ What were yeh doin’ , wanderin ’ off with ruddy Krum ? He ’s from Durmstrang , Harry ! Coulda jinxed yeh right there , couldn ’ he ? Hasn ’ Moody taught yeh nothin’ ? ’ Magine lettin ’ him lure yeh off on yer own — ”
187782	187788	187790	187790	Harry	162	“ Krum ’s all right ! ”
187801	187818	187790	187790	Harry	162	“ He was n’t trying to jinx me , he just wanted to talk about Hermione — ”
187819	187834	187836	187836	Hagrid	205	“ I ’ll be havin’ a few words with her , an ’ all , ”
187844	187870	187836	187836	Hagrid	205	“ The less you lot ’ ave ter do with these foreigners , the happier yeh’ll be . Yeh can ’ trust any of ’em . ”
187871	187882	187883	187883	Harry	162	“ You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime , ”
187888	187899	187901	187901	Hagrid	205	“ Don ’ you talk ter me abou ’ her ! ”
187912	187957	187904	187904	he	205	“ I ’ve got her number now ! Tryin ’ ter get back in me good books , tryin ’ ter get me ter tell her what ’s comin ’ in the third task . Ha ! You can ’ trust any of ’em ! ”
188018	188025	188027	188027	Hermione	186	“ It comes down to this , ”
188033	188053	188027	188027	Hermione	186	“ Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor , or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor was n’t looking . ”
188054	188061	188063	188063	Ron	196	“ It must ’ve been Crouch , ”
188067	188087	188063	188063	Ron	196	“ That ’s why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there . He ’d done a runner . ”
188088	188095	188097	188097	Harry	248	“ I do n’t think so , ”
188103	188121	188097	188097	Harry	248	“ He seemed really weak — I do n’t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything . ”
188122	188140	188142	188142	Hermione	186	“ You ca n’t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds , have n’t I told you enough times ? ”
188144	188154	188156	188156	Ron	196	“ Okay … how ’s this for a theory , ”
188159	188175	188156	188156	Ron	196	“ Krum attacked Crouch — no , wait for it — and then Stunned himself ! ”
188176	188185	188187	188187	Hermione	186	“ And Mr. Crouch evaporated , did he ? ”
188190	188194	188187	188187	Hermione	186	“ Oh yeah … ”
188261	188270	188272	188272	Hermione	186	“ Just go through it again , Harry , ”
188274	188282	188272	188272	Hermione	186	“ What did Mr. Crouch actually say ? ”
188283	188296	188298	188298	Harry	248	“ I ’ve told you , he was n’t making much sense , ”
188300	188340	188298	188298	Harry	248	“ He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something . He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins , and he seemed to think she was dead . He kept saying stuff was his fault . … He mentioned his son . ”
188341	188349	188351	188351	Hermione	186	“ Well , that was his fault , ”
188354	188362	188364	188364	Harry	248	“ He was out of his mind , ”
188366	188395	188364	188364	Harry	248	“ Half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive , and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions . ”
188396	188411	188413	188413	Ron	196	“ And … remind me what he said about You - Know - Who ? ”
188416	188422	188423	188423	Harry	248	“ I ’ve told you , ”
188427	188435	188423	188423	Harry	248	“ He said he ’s getting stronger . ”
188450	188473	188442	188442	Ron	196	“ But he was out of his mind , like you said , so half of it was probably just raving . … ”
188474	188487	188489	188489	Harry	248	“ He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort , ”
188501	188542	188492	188492	Ron	196	“ He was having real trouble stringing two words together , but that was when he seemed to know where he was , and know what he wanted to do . He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore . ”
188593	188602	188603	188603	Harry	248	“ If Snape had n’t held me up , ”
188607	188644	188603	188603	Harry	248	“ we might ’ve got there in time . ‘ The headmaster is busy , Potter … what ’s this rubbish , Potter ? ’ Why could n’t he have just got out of the way ? ”
188645	188656	188658	188658	Ron	196	“ Maybe he did n’t want you to get there ! ”
188661	188691	188658	188658	Ron	196	“ Maybe — hang on — how fast d’you reckon he could ’ve gotten down to the forest ? D’you reckon he could ’ve beaten you and Dumbledore there ? ”
188692	188705	188707	188707	Harry	162	“ Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something , ”
188709	188717	188718	188718	Ron	196	“ Would n’t put it past him , ”
188721	188729	188731	188731	Hermione	186	“ We need to see Professor Moody , ”
188733	188745	188731	188731	Hermione	186	“ We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch . ”
188746	188763	188765	188765	Harry	248	“ If he had the Marauder ’s Map on him , it would ’ve been easy , ”
188767	188776	188778	188778	Ron	196	“ Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds , ”
188780	188793	188778	188778	Ron	196	“ because it only shows up to the boundaries , does n’t — ”
188794	188797	188799	188799	Hermione	186	“ Shh ! ”
188824	188844	188802	188802	Somebody	5371	“ — that ’s blackmail , that is , we could get into a lot of trouble for that — ”
188845	188876	188778	188778	Ron	196	“ — we ’ve tried being polite ; it ’s time to play dirty , like him . He would n’t like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did — ”
188877	188894	188802	188802	Somebody	5371	“ I ’m telling you , if you put that in writing , it ’s blackmail ! ”
188895	188915	188778	188778	Ron	196	“ Yeah , and you wo n’t be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff , will you ? ”
188943	188950	188951	188951	Ron	196	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
188960	188965	188967	188967	Harry	248	“ Sending a letter , ”
188973	188980	188984	188984	Fred	200	“ What , at this time ? ”
188989	189009	189010	189010	he	4151	“ Fine — we wo n’t ask you what you ’re doing , if you do n’t ask us , ”
189049	189060	189061	189061	Fred	200	“ Well , do n’t let us hold you up , ”
189079	189085	189086	189086	he	196	“ Who ’re you blackmailing ? ”
189110	189121	189122	189122	he	196	“ Do n’t be stupid , I was only joking , ”
189126	189133	189135	189135	Ron	196	“ Did n’t sound like that , ”
189150	189181	189146	189146	Fred	200	“ I ’ve told you before , Ron , keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is . Ca n’t see why you would , but — ”
189182	189193	189195	189195	Ron	196	“ It ’s my business if you ’re blackmailing someone , ”
189197	189212	189195	189195	Ron	196	“ George ’s right , you could end up in serious trouble for that . ”
189213	189221	189223	189223	George	201	“ Told you , I was joking , ”
189252	189283	189225	189225	He	196	“ You ’re starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother , you are , Ron . Carry on like this and you ’ll be made a prefect . ”
189284	189291	189293	189293	Ron	196	“ No , I wo n’t ! ”
189318	189333	189310	189310	George	201	“ Well , stop telling people what to do then . See you later . ”
189352	189367	189368	189368	Hermione	186	“ You do n’t think they know something about all this , do you ? ”
189371	189377	189368	189368	Hermione	186	“ About Crouch and everything ? ”
189378	189381	189383	189383	Harry	248	“ No , ”
189385	189403	189383	189383	Harry	248	“ If it was something that serious , they ’d tell someone . They ’d tell Dumbledore . ”
189412	189418	189421	189421	him	196	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
189423	189426	189428	189428	Ron	196	“ Well … ”
189431	189465	189428	189428	Ron	196	“ I dunno if they would . They ’re … they ’re obsessed with making money lately , I noticed it when I was hanging around with them — when — you know — ”
189466	189472	189473	189473	Harry	248	“ We were n’t talking . ”
189480	189486	189473	189473	Harry	248	“ Yeah , but blackmail … ”
189487	189498	189500	189500	Ron	196	“ It ’s this joke shop idea they ’ve got , ”
189502	189566	189500	189500	Ron	196	“ I thought they were only saying it to annoy Mum , but they really mean it , they want to start one . They ’ve only got a year left at Hogwarts , they keep going on about how it ’s time to think about their future , and Dad ca n’t help them , and they need gold to get started . ”
189573	189590	189567	189567	Hermione	186	“ Yes , but … they would n’t do anything against the law to get gold . ”
189591	189596	189598	189598	Ron	196	“ Would n’t they ? ”
189603	189618	189598	189598	Ron	196	“ I dunno … they do n’t exactly mind breaking rules , do they ? ”
189619	189628	189630	189630	Hermione	186	“ Yes , but this is the law , ”
189635	189666	189630	189630	Hermione	186	“ This is n’t some silly school rule . … They ’ll get a lot more than detention for blackmail ! Ron … maybe you ’d better tell Percy . … ”
189667	189672	189674	189674	Ron	196	“ Are you mad ? ”
189676	189691	189674	189674	Ron	196	“ Tell Percy ? He ’d probably do a Crouch and turn them in . ”
189709	189719	189692	189692	He	196	“ Come on , let ’s get some breakfast . ”
189720	189734	189735	189735	Hermione	186	“ D’you think it ’s too early to go and see Professor Moody ? ”
189745	189748	189750	189750	Harry	248	“ Yes , ”
189752	189792	189750	189750	Harry	248	“ He ’d probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn ; he ’ll think we ’re trying to attack him while he ’s asleep . Let ’s give it till break . ”
189935	189939	189940	189940	Harry	248	“ Professor Moody ? ”
189953	189958	189960	189960	Moody	394	“ Hello , Potter , ”
190000	190005	189996	189996	he	394	“ Come in here . ”
190027	190033	190034	190034	Harry	162	“ Did you find him ? ”
190039	190043	190034	190034	Harry	162	“ Mr. Crouch ? ”
190044	190047	190049	190049	Moody	394	“ No , ”
190078	190085	190086	190086	Harry	248	“ Did you use the map ? ”
190089	190093	190095	190095	Moody	394	“ Of course , ”
190104	190131	190095	190095	Moody	394	“ Took a leaf out of your book , Potter . Summoned it from my office into the forest . He was n’t anywhere on there . ”
190132	190138	190140	190140	Ron	196	“ So he did Disapparate ? ”
190142	190153	190155	190155	Hermione	186	“ You ca n’t Disapparate on the grounds , Ron ! ”
190157	190173	190155	190155	Hermione	186	“ There are other ways he could have disappeared , are n’t there , Professor ? ”
190185	190200	190201	190201	he	394	“ You ’re another one who might think about a career as an Auror , ”
190205	190214	190201	190201	he	394	“ Mind works the right way , Granger . ”
190221	190229	190231	190231	Harry	162	“ Well , he was n’t invisible , ”
190233	190249	190231	190231	Harry	162	“ The map shows invisible people . He must ’ve left the grounds , then . ”
190250	190257	190259	190259	Hermione	186	“ But under his own steam ? ”
190262	190269	190259	190259	Hermione	186	“ or because someone made him ? ”
190270	190294	190296	190296	Ron	196	“ Yeah , someone could ’ve — could ’ve pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him , could n’t they ? ”
190319	190327	190329	190329	Moody	394	“ We ca n’t rule out kidnap , ”
190331	190334	190336	190336	Ron	196	“ So , ”
190338	190347	190336	190336	Ron	196	“ d’you reckon he ’s somewhere in Hogsmeade ? ”
190348	190353	190355	190355	Moody	394	“ Could be anywhere , ”
190361	190375	190355	190355	Moody	394	“ Only thing we know for sure is that he ’s not here . ”
190401	190450	190398	190398	he	196	“ Now , Dumbledore ’s told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators , but there ’s nothing you can do for Crouch . The Ministry’ll be looking for him now , Dumbledore ’s notified them . Potter , you just keep your mind on the third task . ”
190451	190454	190456	190456	Harry	162	“ What ? ”
190458	190462	190456	190456	Harry	162	“ Oh yeah … ”
190483	190494	190496	190496	Moody	394	“ Should be right up your street , this one , ”
190510	190552	190496	190496	Moody	394	“ From what Dumbledore ’s said , you ’ve managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times . Broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerer ’s Stone in your first year , did n’t you ? ”
190553	190557	190558	190558	Ron	196	“ We helped , ”
190562	190568	190558	190558	Ron	196	“ Me and Hermione helped . ”
190572	190594	190596	190596	Moody	394	“ Well , help him practice for this one , and I ’ll be very surprised if he does n’t win , ”
190598	190611	190612	190612	He	394	“ In the meantime … constant vigilance , Potter . Constant vigilance . ”
190643	190647	190649	190649	Moody	394	“ You two , ”
190659	190691	190651	190651	his	394	“ you stick close to Potter , all right ? I ’m keeping an eye on things , but all the same … you can never have too many eyes out . ”
190748	190759	190735	190735	She	186	“ Ha ! She has n’t got wind of Crouch ! ”
190971	190987	190989	190989	Harry	248	“ Who ’s he , to lecture me about being out - of - bounds ? ”
191007	191017	190994	190994	he	248	“ After all the stuff he did at school ! ”
191018	191025	191027	191027	Hermione	186	“ He ’s worried about you ! ”
191030	191042	191027	191027	Hermione	186	“ Just like Moody and Hagrid ! So listen to them ! ”
191043	191054	191056	191056	Harry	248	“ No one ’s tried to attack me all year , ”
191058	191069	191056	191056	Harry	248	“ No one ’s done anything to me at all — ”
191070	191081	191083	191083	Hermione	186	“ Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire , ”
191085	191122	191083	191083	Hermione	186	“ And they must ’ve done that for a reason , Harry . Snuffles is right . Maybe they ’ve been biding their time . Maybe this is the task they ’re going to get you . ”
191123	191126	191128	191128	Harry	248	“ Look , ”
191131	191195	191128	191128	Harry	248	“ let ’s say Sirius is right , and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch . Well , they would ’ve been in the trees near us , would n’t they ? But they waited till I was out of the way until they acted , did n’t they ? So it does n’t look like I ’m their target , does it ? ”
191196	191216	191218	191218	Hermione	186	“ They could n’t have made it look like an accident if they ’d murdered you in the forest ! ”
191220	191229	191218	191218	Hermione	186	“ But if you die during a task — ”
191230	191242	191244	191244	Harry	248	“ They did n’t care about attacking Krum , did they ? ”
191246	191276	191244	191244	Harry	248	“ Why did n’t they just polish me off at the same time ? They could ’ve made it look like Krum and I had a duel or something . ”
191277	191287	191289	191289	Hermione	186	“ Harry , I do n’t understand it either , ”
191292	191360	191289	191289	Hermione	186	“ I just know there are a lot of odd things going on , and I do n’t like it . … Moody ’s right — Sirius is right — you ’ve got to get in training for the third task , straight away . And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you ’re not going to go sneaking off alone again . ”
191446	191454	191455	191455	Ron	196	“ Ca n’t we kidnap Mrs. Norris ? ”
191491	191524	191526	191526	he	196	“ Let ’s Stun her for a bit . Or you could use Dobby , Harry , I bet he ’d do anything to help you . I ’m not complaining or anything ”
191537	191546	191526	191526	he	196	“ but I ’m aching all over . … ”
191547	191560	191562	191562	Hermione	186	“ Well , you keep missing the cushions , do n’t you ! ”
191586	191593	191579	191579	Flitwick	365	“ Just try and fall backward ! ”
191594	191609	191611	191611	Ron	196	“ Once you ’re Stunned , you ca n’t aim too well , Hermione ! ”
191614	191623	191611	191611	Ron	196	“ Why do n’t you take a turn ? ”
191624	191637	191639	191639	Hermione	186	“ Well , I think Harry ’s got it now , anyway , ”
191642	191679	191639	191639	Hermione	186	“ And we do n’t have to worry about Disarming , because he ’s been able to do that for ages . … I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening . ”
191692	191701	191702	191702	she	186	“ I like the look of this one , ”
191705	191730	191702	191702	she	186	“ this Impediment Curse . Should slow down anything that ’s trying to attack you , Harry . We ’ll start with that one . ”
191752	191758	191763	191763	she	186	“ See you at dinner ! ”
191812	191831	191833	191833	Ron	196	“ It ’s going to be boiling in Trelawney ’s room , she never puts out that fire , ”
191935	191939	191941	191942	Professor Trelawney	335	“ My dears , ”
191967	192020	191962	191962	her	335	“ we have almost finished our work on planetary divination . Today , however , will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars , for he is placed most interestingly at the present time . If you will all look this way , I will dim the lights . … ”
192344	192352	192311	192312	the other	1027	“ You are in luck , Wormtail , ”
192374	192392	192311	192312	the other	1027	“ You are very fortunate indeed . Your blunder has not ruined everything . He is dead . ”
192393	192397	192399	192403	the man on the floor	4200	“ My Lord ! ”
192405	192422	192399	192403	the man on the floor	4200	“ My Lord , I am … I am so pleased … and so sorry . … ”
192423	192426	192428	192430	the cold voice	744	“ Nagini , ”
192432	192465	192428	192430	the cold voice	744	“ you are out of luck . I will not be feeding Wormtail to you , after all … but never mind , never mind … there is still Harry Potter . … ”
192477	192482	192484	192486	the cold voice	744	“ Now , Wormtail , ”
192488	192505	192484	192486	the cold voice	744	“ perhaps one more little reminder why I will not tolerate another blunder from you . … ”
192506	192516	192542	192544	the cold voice	744	“ My Lord … no … I beg you … ”
192537	192540	192542	192544	the cold voice	744	“ Crucio ! ”
192595	192600	192577	192577	he	162	“ Harry ! Harry ! ”
192662	192667	192668	192668	he	196	“ You all right ? ”
192671	192678	192680	192681	Professor Trelawney	335	“ Of course he is n’t ! ”
192698	192716	192687	192687	Her	335	“ What was it , Potter ? A premonition ? An apparition ? What did you see ? ”
192717	192720	192721	192721	Harry	162	“ Nothing , ”
192758	192765	192767	192768	Professor Trelawney	335	“ You were clutching your scar ! ”
192770	192794	192767	192768	Professor Trelawney	335	“ You were rolling on the floor , clutching your scar ! Come now , Potter , I have experience in these matters ! ”
192801	192814	192815	192815	he	162	“ I need to go to the hospital wing , I think , ”
192818	192822	192815	192815	he	162	“ Bad headache . ”
192823	192840	192842	192843	Professor Trelawney	335	“ My dear , you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room ! ”
192844	192863	192842	192843	Professor Trelawney	335	“ If you leave now , you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever — ”
192864	192877	192879	192879	Harry	162	“ I do n’t want to see anything except a headache cure , ”
192895	192900	192901	192901	Harry	162	“ See you later , ”
193163	193167	193168	193168	he	162	“ Sherbet lemon ? ”
193178	193181	193183	193183	Harry	162	“ Okay , ”
193189	193235	193236	193236	he	162	“ Pear Drop . Er — Licorice Wand . Fizzing Whizbee . Drooble ’s Best Blowing Gum . Bertie Bott ’s Every Flavor Beans … oh no , he does n’t like them , does he ? … oh just open , ca n’t you ? ”
193240	193252	193236	193236	he	162	“ I really need to see him , it ’s urgent ! ”
193273	193277	193278	193278	he	162	“ Chocolate Frog ! ”
193287	193294	193278	193278	he	162	“ Sugar Quill ! Cockroach Cluster ! ”
193307	193311	193312	193312	he	162	“ Cockroach Cluster ? ”
193317	193324	193312	193312	he	162	“ I was only joking . … ”
193389	193409	193378	193378	He	162	“ Dumbledore , I ’m afraid I do n’t see the connection , do n’t see it at all ! ”
193423	193478	193420	193421	Cornelius Fudge	288	“ Ludo says Bertha ’s perfectly capable of getting herself lost . I agree we would have expected to have found her by now , but all the same , we ’ve no evidence of foul play , Dumbledore , none at all . As for her disappearance being linked with Barty Crouch ’s ! ”
193479	193492	193494	193494	Moody	394	“ And what do you thinks happened to Barty Crouch , Minister ? ”
193499	193507	193509	193509	Fudge	288	“ I see two possibilities , Alastor , ”
193511	193544	193509	193509	Fudge	288	“ Either Crouch has finally cracked — more than likely , I ’m sure you ’ll agree , given his personal history — lost his mind , and gone wandering off somewhere — ”
193545	193559	193561	193561	Dumbledore	195	“ He wandered extremely quickly , if that is the case , Cornelius , ”
193564	193570	193571	193571	Fudge	288	“ Or else — well … ”
193575	193614	193571	193571	Fudge	288	“ Well , I ’ll reserve judgment until after I ’ve seen the place where he was found , but you say it was just past the Beauxbatons carriage ? Dumbledore , you know what that woman is ? ”
193615	193631	193633	193633	Dumbledore	195	“ I consider her to be a very able headmistress — and an excellent dancer , ”
193636	193641	193643	193643	Fudge	288	“ Dumbledore , come ! ”
193646	193688	193643	193643	Fudge	288	“ Do n’t you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid ? They do n’t all turn out harmless — if , indeed , you can call Hagrid harmless , with that monster fixation he ’s got — ”
193689	193699	193701	193701	Dumbledore	195	“ I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid , ”
193707	193722	193701	193701	Dumbledore	195	“ I think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced , Cornelius . ”
193723	193731	193733	193733	Moody	394	“ Can we wrap up this discussion ? ”
193735	193750	193752	193752	Fudge	288	“ Yes , yes , let ’s go down to the grounds , then , ”
193755	193763	193765	193765	Moody	394	“ No , it ’s not that , ”
193767	193788	193765	193765	Moody	394	“ it ’s just that Potter wants a word with you , Dumbledore . He ’s just outside the door . ”
193800	193805	193807	193807	Moody	394	“ Hello , Potter , ”
193809	193815	193807	193807	Moody	394	“ Come in , then . ”
193887	193890	193892	193892	Fudge	288	“ Harry ! ”
193898	193903	193892	193892	Fudge	288	“ How are you ? ”
193904	193907	193908	193908	Harry	162	“ Fine , ”
193911	193928	193930	193930	Fudge	288	“ We were just talking about the night when Mr. Crouch turned up on the grounds , ”
193932	193944	193930	193930	Fudge	288	“ It was you who found him , was it not ? ”
193945	193948	193950	193950	Harry	248	“ Yes , ”
193974	193997	193971	193971	he	248	“ I did n’t see Madame Maxime anywhere , though , and she ’d have a job hiding , would n’t she ? ”
194011	194016	194018	194018	Fudge	288	“ Yes , well , ”
194023	194055	194018	194018	Fudge	288	“ we ’re about to go for a short walk on the grounds , Harry , if you ’ll excuse us … perhaps if you just go back to your class — ”
194056	194066	194067	194067	Harry	248	“ I wanted to talk to you , Professor , ”
194084	194092	194093	194093	he	195	“ Wait here for me , Harry , ”
194096	194107	194093	194093	he	195	“ Our examination of the grounds will not take long . ”
194146	194151	194152	194152	he	248	“ Hello , Fawkes , ”
195218	195221	195222	195222	Harry	248	“ Professor ! ”
195231	195259	195222	195222	Harry	248	“ I ’m sorry — I did n’t mean to — I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet — I — where are we ? ”
195832	195836	195864	195864	Crouch	248	“ Igor Karkaroff , ”
195883	195913	195877	195877	he	248	“ You have been brought from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic . You have given us to understand that you have important information for us . ”
195928	195934	195935	195935	he	248	“ I have , sir , ”
195957	196008	195935	195935	he	248	“ I wish to be of use to the Ministry . I wish to help . I — I know that the Ministry is trying to — to round up the last of the Dark Lord ’s supporters . I am eager to assist in any way I can . … ”
196054	196057	196042	196042	Dumbledore	195	“ Filth . ”
196117	196126	196127	196127	Moody	344	“ Crouch is going to let him out , ”
196133	196185	196127	196127	Moody	344	“ He ’s done a deal with him . Took me six months to track him down , and Crouch is going to let him go if he ’s got enough new names . Let ’s hear his information , I say , and throw him straight back to the dementors . ”
196200	196219	196221	196221	Moody	344	“ Ah , I was forgetting … you do n’t like the dementors , do you , Albus ? ”
196227	196230	196232	196232	Dumbledore	195	“ No , ”
196235	196258	196232	196232	Dumbledore	195	“ I ’m afraid I do n’t . I have long felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures . ”
196259	196266	196267	196267	Moody	344	“ But for filth like this … ”
196271	196282	196284	196285	Mr. Crouch	248	“ You say you have names for us , Karkaroff , ”
196287	196295	196284	196285	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Let us hear them , please . ”
196296	196301	196303	196303	Karkaroff	430	“ You must understand , ”
196306	196356	196303	196303	Karkaroff	430	“ that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named operated always in the greatest secrecy . … He preferred that we — I mean to say , his supporters — and I regret now , very deeply , that I ever counted myself among them — ”
196357	196363	196365	196365	Moody	344	“ Get on with it , ”
196367	196390	196365	196365	Moody	344	“ — we never knew the names of every one of our fellows — He alone knew exactly who we all were — ”
196391	196418	196420	196420	Moody	344	“ Which was a wise move , was n’t it , as it prevented someone like you , Karkaroff , from turning all of them in , ”
196422	196433	196435	196436	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Yet you say you have some names for us ? ”
196438	196444	196446	196446	Karkaroff	430	“ I — I do , ”
196449	196497	196446	196446	Karkaroff	430	“ And these were important supporters , mark you . People I saw with my own eyes doing his bidding . I give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him , and am filled with a remorse so deep I can barely — ”
196498	196503	196505	196506	Mr. Crouch	248	“ These names are ? ”
196515	196521	196522	196522	he	430	“ There was Antonin Dolohov , ”
196525	196545	196522	196522	he	430	“ I — I saw him torture countless Muggles and — and non - supporters of the Dark Lord . ”
196546	196553	196555	196555	Moody	344	“ And helped him do it , ”
196557	196564	196566	196566	Crouch	248	“ We have already apprehended Dolohov , ”
196568	196576	196566	196566	Crouch	248	“ He was caught shortly after yourself . ”
196577	196580	196582	196582	Karkaroff	430	“ Indeed ? ”
196588	196598	196582	196582	Karkaroff	430	“ I — I am delighted to hear it ! ”
196628	196632	196634	196634	Crouch	248	“ Any others ? ”
196637	196646	196648	196648	Karkaroff	430	“ Why , yes … there was Rosier , ”
196651	196655	196648	196648	Karkaroff	430	“ Evan Rosier . ”
196656	196661	196663	196663	Crouch	248	“ Rosier is dead , ”
196665	196690	196663	196663	Crouch	248	“ He was caught shortly after you were too . He preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle . ”
196691	196702	196704	196704	Moody	344	“ Took a bit of me with him , though , ”
196732	196741	196743	196743	Karkaroff	430	“ No — no more than Rosier deserved ! ”
196799	196803	196805	196805	Crouch	248	“ Any more ? ”
196807	196810	196812	196812	Karkaroff	430	“ Yes ! ”
196814	196870	196812	196812	Karkaroff	430	“ There was Travers — he helped murder the McKinnons ! Mulciber — he specialized in the Imperius Curse , forced countless people to do horrific things ! Rookwood , who was a spy , and passed He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named useful information from inside the Ministry itself ! ”
196892	196895	196897	196898	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Rookwood ? ”
196919	196928	196914	196914	her	4305	“ Augustus Rookwood of the Department of Mysteries ? ”
196929	196934	196936	196936	Karkaroff	430	“ The very same , ”
196939	196963	196936	196936	Karkaroff	430	“ I believe he used a network of well - placed wizards , both inside the Ministry and out , to collect information — ”
196964	196972	196974	196975	Mr. Crouch	248	“ But Travers and Mulciber we have , ”
196977	196998	196974	196975	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Very well , Karkaroff , if that is all , you will be returned to Azkaban while we decide — ”
196999	197003	197005	197005	Karkaroff	430	“ Not yet ! ”
197011	197018	197005	197005	Karkaroff	430	“ Wait , I have more ! ”
197042	197045	197046	197046	he	430	“ Snape ! ”
197049	197053	197046	197046	he	430	“ Severus Snape ! ”
197054	197063	197065	197065	Crouch	248	“ Snape has been cleared by this council , ”
197068	197078	197065	197065	Crouch	248	“ He has been vouched for by Albus Dumbledore . ”
197079	197082	197084	197084	Karkaroff	430	“ No ! ”
197097	197109	197084	197084	Karkaroff	430	“ I assure you ! Severus Snape is a Death Eater ! ”
197117	197127	197128	197128	he	195	“ I have given evidence already on this matter , ”
197132	197175	197128	197128	he	195	“ Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater . However , he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort ’s downfall and turned spy for us , at great personal risk . He is now no more a Death Eater than I am . ”
197199	197205	197206	197206	Crouch	248	“ Very well , Karkaroff , ”
197210	197233	197206	197206	Crouch	248	“ you have been of assistance . I shall review your case . You will return to Azkaban in the meantime . … ”
197546	197575	197577	197578	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Ludo Bagman , you have been brought here in front of the Council of Magical Law to answer charges relating to the activities of the Death Eaters , ”
197580	197611	197577	197578	Mr. Crouch	248	“ We have heard the evidence against you , and are about to reach our verdict . Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment ? ”
197626	197629	197631	197631	Bagman	230	“ Only , ”
197636	197650	197631	197631	Bagman	230	“ well — I know I ’ve been a bit of an idiot — ”
197691	197701	197702	197702	someone	908	“ You never spoke a truer word , boy , ”
197720	197747	197715	197715	Moody	344	“ If I did n’t know he ’d always been dim , I ’d have said some of those Bludgers had permanently affected his brain . … ”
197748	197763	197765	197766	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Ludovic Bagman , you were caught passing information to Lord Voldemort ’s supporters , ”
197768	197785	197765	197766	Mr. Crouch	248	“ For this , I suggest a term of imprisonment in Azkaban lasting no less than — ”
197822	197834	197835	197835	Bagman	568	“ But I ’ve told you , I had no idea ! ”
197850	197935	197844	197844	his	568	“ None at all ! Old Rookwood was a friend of my dad ’s … never crossed my mind he was in with You - Know - Who ! I thought I was collecting information for our side ! And Rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the Ministry later on … once my Quidditch days are over , you know … I mean , I ca n’t keep getting hit by Bludgers for the rest of my life , can I ? ”
197943	197952	197954	197955	Mr. Crouch	248	“ It will be put to the vote , ”
197970	197985	197958	197958	He	248	“ The jury will please raise their hands … those in favor of imprisonment … ”
198028	198031	198033	198033	Crouch	248	“ Yes ? ”
198035	198059	198060	198061	the witch	4330	“ We ’d just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his splendid performance for England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last Saturday , ”
198088	198091	198092	198093	Mr. Crouch	248	“ Despicable , ”
198108	198134	198101	198101	Bagman	230	“ Rookwood get him a job indeed . … The day Ludo Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the Ministry . … ”
198234	198239	198240	198240	he	248	“ Bring them in , ”
198458	198471	198472	198472	he	248	“ You have been brought here before the Council of Magical Law , ”
198476	198492	198472	198472	he	248	“ so that we may pass judgment on you , for a crime so heinous — ”
198493	198496	198498	198505	the boy with the straw - colored hair	4348	“ Father , ”
198507	198512	198498	198505	the boy with the straw - colored hair	4348	“ Father … please … ”
198513	198528	198530	198530	Crouch	248	“ — that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court , ”
198543	198600	198530	198530	Crouch	248	“ We have heard the evidence against you . The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror — Frank Longbottom — and subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse , believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master , He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named — ”
198601	198608	198610	198614	the boy in chains below	4350	“ Father , I did n’t ! ”
198616	198636	198610	198614	the boy in chains below	4350	“ I did n’t , I swear it , Father , do n’t send me back to the dementors — ”
198637	198643	198645	198646	Mr. Crouch	248	“ You are further accused , ”
198648	198707	198645	198646	Mr. Crouch	248	“ of using the Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom ’s wife , when he would not give you information . You planned to restore He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named to power , and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong . I now ask the jury — ”
198708	198711	198713	198714	the boy	4978	“ Mother ! ”
198733	198752	198718	198723	the wispy little witch beside Crouch	4347	“ Mother , stop him , Mother , I did n’t do it , it was n’t me ! ”
198753	198760	198762	198763	Mr. Crouch	248	“ I now ask the jury , ”
198765	198788	198762	198763	Mr. Crouch	248	“ to raise their hands if they believe , as I do , that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban ! ”
198836	198871	198830	198831	The boy	4978	“ No ! Mother , no ! I did n’t do it , I did n’t do it , I did n’t know ! Do n’t send me there , do n’t let him ! ”
198907	198959	198903	198903	Crouch	248	“ The Dark Lord will rise again , Crouch ! Throw us into Azkaban ; we will wait ! He will rise again and will come for us , he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters ! We alone were faithful ! We alone tried to find him ! ”
199014	199020	199021	199021	he	4978	“ I ’m your son ! ”
199027	199033	199021	199021	he	4978	“ I ’m your son ! ”
199034	199042	199044	199045	Mr. Crouch	248	“ You are no son of mine ! ”
199052	199058	199047	199047	his	248	“ I have no son ! ”
199085	199090	199091	199091	Crouch	248	“ Take them away ! ”
199103	199114	199091	199091	Crouch	248	“ Take them away , and may they rot there ! ”
199115	199133	199091	199091	Crouch	248	“ Father ! Father , I was n’t involved ! No ! No ! Father , please ! ”
199134	199149	199091	199091	Crouch	248	“ I think , Harry , it is time to return to my office , ”
199210	199213	199215	199216	the Dumbledore	195	“ Come , ”
199309	199312	199313	199313	Harry	248	“ Professor , ”
199316	199338	199313	199313	Harry	248	“ I know I should n’t ’ve — I did n’t mean — the cabinet door was sort of open and — ”
199339	199344	199346	199346	Dumbledore	195	“ I quite understand , ”
199416	199421	199422	199422	Harry	248	“ What is it ? ”
199426	199435	199437	199437	Dumbledore	195	“ This ? It is called a Pensieve , ”
199439	199467	199437	199437	Dumbledore	195	“ I sometimes find , and I am sure you know the feeling , that I simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind . ”
199468	199471	199473	199473	Harry	248	“ Er , ”
199490	199495	199497	199497	Dumbledore	195	“ At these times , ”
199504	199554	199497	199497	Dumbledore	195	“ I use the Pensieve . One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one ’s mind , pours them into the basin , and examines them at one ’s leisure . It becomes easier to spot patterns and links , you understand , when they are in this form . ”
199555	199565	199566	199566	Harry	248	“ You mean … that stuff ’s your thoughts ? ”
199579	199582	199584	199584	Dumbledore	195	“ Certainly , ”
199586	199592	199584	199584	Dumbledore	195	“ Let me show you . ”
199738	199754	199725	199725	his	368	“ It ’s coming back … Karkaroff ’s too … stronger and clearer than ever … ”
199755	199765	199766	199766	Dumbledore	195	“ A connection I could have made without assistance , ”
199769	199774	199775	199775	He	195	“ but never mind . ”
199806	199845	199793	199793	Snape	368	“ I was using the Pensieve when Mr. Fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily . Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door properly . Naturally , it would have attracted your attention . ”
199846	199851	199852	199852	Harry	248	“ I ’m sorry , ”
199860	199867	199868	199868	he	195	“ Curiosity is not a sin , ”
199871	199885	199868	199868	he	195	“ But we should exercise caution with our curiosity … yes , indeed … ”
199972	200008	199950	199950	her	4378	“ He put a hex on me , Professor Dumbledore , and I was only teasing him , sir . I only said I ’d seen him kissing Florence behind the greenhouses last Thursday . … ”
200009	200015	200017	200017	Dumbledore	195	“ But why , Bertha , ”
200029	200042	200017	200017	Dumbledore	195	“ why did you have to follow him in the first place ? ”
200043	200046	200047	200047	Harry	248	“ Bertha ? ”
200055	200064	200047	200047	Harry	248	“ Is that — was that Bertha Jorkins ? ”
200065	200068	200070	200070	Dumbledore	195	“ Yes , ”
200095	200106	200080	200080	Bertha	185	“ That was Bertha as I remember her at school . ”
200157	200162	200164	200164	Dumbledore	195	“ So , Harry , ”
200167	200183	200164	200164	Dumbledore	195	“ Before you got lost in my thoughts , you wanted to tell me something . ”
200184	200187	200189	200189	Harry	248	“ Yes , ”
200191	200209	200189	200189	Harry	248	“ Professor — I was in Divination just now , and — er — I fell asleep . ”
200226	200232	200222	200222	Dumbledore	195	“ Quite understandable . Continue . ”
200233	200241	200243	200243	Harry	248	“ Well , I had a dream , ”
200245	200262	200243	200243	Harry	248	“ A dream about Lord Voldemort . He was torturing Wormtail … you know who Wormtail — ”
200263	200268	200270	200270	Dumbledore	195	“ I do know , ”
200273	200277	200270	200270	Dumbledore	195	“ Please continue . ”
200278	200355	200356	200356	Harry	248	“ Voldemort got a letter from an owl . He said something like , Wormtail ’s blunder had been repaired . He said someone was dead . Then he said , Wormtail would n’t be fed to the snake — there was a snake beside his chair . He said — he said he ’d be feeding me to it , instead . Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail — and my scar hurt , ”
200359	200370	200356	200356	Harry	248	“ It woke me up , it hurt so badly . ”
200377	200384	200386	200386	Harry	248	“ Er — that ’s all , ”
200388	200392	200394	200394	Dumbledore	195	“ I see , ”
200397	200425	200394	200394	Dumbledore	195	“ I see . Now , has your scar hurt at any other time this year , excepting the time it woke you up over the summer ? ”
200426	200443	200445	200445	Harry	248	“ No , I — how did you know it woke me up over the summer ? ”
200449	200458	200460	200460	Dumbledore	195	“ You are not Sirius ’s only correspondent , ”
200462	200496	200460	200460	Dumbledore	195	“ I have also been in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year . It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay . ”
200562	200565	200566	200566	he	195	“ Professor ? ”
200584	200588	200589	200589	he	195	“ My apologies , ”
200601	200613	200593	200593	He	195	“ D’you — d’you know why my scar ’s hurting me ? ”
200628	200668	200614	200614	Dumbledore	195	“ I have a theory , no more than that . … It is my belief that your scar hurts both when Lord Voldemort is near you , and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred . ”
200669	200674	200614	200614	Dumbledore	195	“ But … why ? ”
200675	200688	200690	200690	Dumbledore	195	“ Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed , ”
200692	200699	200690	200690	Dumbledore	195	“ That is no ordinary scar . ”
200700	200713	200614	200614	Dumbledore	195	“ So you think … that dream … did it really happen ? ”
200714	200719	200721	200721	Dumbledore	195	“ It is possible , ”
200723	200737	200721	200721	Dumbledore	195	“ I would say — probable . Harry — did you see Voldemort ? ”
200738	200741	200743	200743	Harry	248	“ No , ”
200745	200792	200793	200793	Harry	248	“ Just the back of his chair . But — there would n’t have been anything to see , would there ? I mean , he has n’t got a body , has he ? But … but then how could he have held the wand ? ”
200797	200801	200803	200803	Dumbledore	195	“ How indeed ? ”
200805	200809	200803	200803	Dumbledore	195	“ How indeed … ”
200854	200857	200858	200858	Harry	248	“ Professor , ”
200863	200872	200858	200858	Harry	248	“ do you think he ’s getting stronger ? ”
200873	200876	200878	200878	Dumbledore	195	“ Voldemort ? ”
200927	200941	200909	200909	Dumbledore	195	“ Once again , Harry , I can only give you my suspicions . ”
200957	200967	200968	200968	he	195	“ The years of Voldemort ’s ascent to power , ”
200971	201081	200968	200968	he	195	“ were marked with disappearances . Bertha Jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where Voldemort was certainly known to be last . Mr. Crouch too has disappeared … within these very grounds . And there was a third disappearance , one which the Ministry , I regret to say , do not consider of any importance , for it concerns a Muggle . His name was Frank Bryce , he lived in the village where Voldemort ’s father grew up , and he has not been seen since last August . You see , I read the Muggle newspapers , unlike most of my Ministry friends . ”
201089	201115	201082	201082	Dumbledore	195	“ These disappearances seem to me to be linked . The Ministry disagrees — as you may have heard , while waiting outside my office . ”
201151	201154	201155	201155	he	195	“ Professor ? ”
201159	201164	201166	201166	Dumbledore	195	“ Yes , Harry ? ”
201168	201188	201166	201166	Dumbledore	195	“ Er … could I ask you about … that court thing I was in … in the Pensieve ? ”
201189	201193	201195	201195	Dumbledore	195	“ You could , ”
201198	201221	201195	201195	Dumbledore	195	“ I attended it many times , but some trials come back to me more clearly than others … particularly now . … ”
201222	201252	201166	201166	Dumbledore	195	“ You know — you know the trial you found me in ? The one with Crouch ’s son ? Well … were they talking about Neville ’s parents ? ”
201261	201277	201278	201278	he	195	“ Has Neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother ? ”
201311	201322	201324	201324	Dumbledore	195	“ Yes , they were talking about Neville ’s parents , ”
201326	201362	201324	201324	Dumbledore	195	“ His father , Frank , was an Auror just like Professor Moody . He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort ’s whereabouts after he lost his powers , as you heard . ”
201363	201369	201371	201371	Harry	248	“ So they ’re dead ? ”
201374	201377	201379	201379	Dumbledore	195	“ No , ”
201394	201433	201379	201379	Dumbledore	195	“ They are insane . They are both in St. Mungo ’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries . I believe Neville visits them , with his grandmother , during the holidays . They do not recognize him . ”
201458	201465	201467	201467	Dumbledore	195	“ The Longbottoms were very popular , ”
201469	201534	201467	201467	Dumbledore	195	“ The attacks on them came after Voldemort ’s fall from power , just when everyone thought they were safe . Those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never known . The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it . Unfortunately , the Longbottoms ’ evidence was — given their condition — none too reliable . ”
201535	201547	201549	201549	Harry	248	“ Then Mr. Crouch ’s son might not have been involved ? ”
201557	201567	201554	201554	his	195	“ As to that , I have no idea . ”
201604	201607	201608	201608	he	248	“ Er , ”
201611	201615	201608	201608	he	248	“ Mr. Bagman … ”
201616	201628	201630	201630	Dumbledore	195	“ … has never been accused of any Dark activity since , ”
201633	201636	201638	201638	Harry	248	“ Right , ”
201663	201668	201657	201657	Dumbledore	195	“ And … er … ”
201703	201710	201711	201711	he	195	“ No more has Professor Snape , ”
201742	201756	201717	201717	Dumbledore	195	“ What made you think he ’d really stopped supporting Voldemort , Professor ? ”
201771	201785	201757	201757	Dumbledore	195	“ That , Harry , is a matter between Professor Snape and myself . ”
201826	201829	201830	201830	he	195	“ Harry , ”
201838	201865	201830	201830	he	195	“ Please do not speak about Neville ’s parents to anybody else . He has the right to let people know , when he is ready . ”
201866	201871	201873	201873	Harry	248	“ Yes , Professor , ”
201879	201882	201830	201830	he	195	“ And — ”
201923	201931	201911	201911	He	195	“ Good luck with the third task . ”
201937	201952	201953	201953	Ron	196	“ Dumbledore reckons You - Know - Who ’s getting stronger again as well ? ”
202086	202092	202093	202093	Ron	196	“ And he trusts Snape ? ”
202096	202112	202093	202093	Ron	196	“ He really trusts Snape , even though he knows he was a Death Eater ? ”
202113	202116	202118	202118	Harry	248	“ Yes , ”
202158	202162	202163	202163	she	186	“ Rita Skeeter , ”
202167	202177	202179	202179	Ron	196	“ How can you be worrying about her now ? ”
202185	202193	202194	202194	Hermione	186	“ I ’m not worrying about her , ”
202200	202292	202194	202194	Hermione	186	“ I ’m just thinking … remember what she said to me in the Three Broomsticks ? ‘ I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl . ’ This is what she meant , is n’t it ? She reported his trial , she knew he ’d passed information to the Death Eaters . And Winky too , remember … ‘ Ludo Bagman ’s a bad wizard . ’ Mr. Crouch would have been furious he got off , he would have talked about it at home . ”
202293	202308	202309	202309	Hermione	186	“ Yeah , but Bagman did n’t pass information on purpose , did he ? ”
202312	202321	202322	202322	Ron	196	“ And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch ? ”
202330	202333	202335	202335	Harry	248	“ Yeah , ”
202337	202352	202335	202335	Harry	248	“ but he ’s only saying that because Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage . ”
202353	202363	202365	202365	Ron	196	“ We never thought of her , did we ? ”
202368	202388	202365	202365	Ron	196	“ Mind you , she ’s definitely got giant blood , and she does n’t want to admit it — ”
202389	202396	202398	202398	Hermione	186	“ Of course she does n’t , ”
202404	202464	202398	202398	Hermione	186	“ Look what happened to Hagrid when Rita found out about his mother . Look at Fudge , jumping to conclusions about her , just because she ’s part giant . Who needs that sort of prejudice ? I ’d probably say I had big bones if I knew that ’s what I ’d get for telling the truth . ”
202471	202479	202480	202480	she	186	“ We have n’t done any practicing ! ”
202486	202519	202480	202480	she	186	“ We were going to do the Impediment Curse ! We ’ll have to really get down to it tomorrow ! Come on , Harry , you need to get some sleep . ”
202792	202799	202800	202800	Hermione	186	“ Do n’t worry about it , ”
202824	202852	202804	202804	Harry	248	“ at least we ’ll get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts . We ’d never have found out about all these hexes in class . ”
202853	202863	202865	202865	Ron	196	“ Good training for when we ’re all Aurors , ”
203162	203172	203173	203173	Hermione	186	“ You ’re still doing really well , though , ”
203191	203202	203179	203179	her	186	“ Some of these are bound to come in handy . ”
203203	203210	203212	203212	Ron	196	“ Come and look at this , ”
203229	203235	203221	203221	He	196	“ What ’s Malfoy doing ? ”
203287	203299	203301	203301	Harry	248	“ He looks like he ’s using a walkie - talkie , ”
203304	203310	203312	203312	Hermione	186	“ He ca n’t be , ”
203314	203335	203336	203336	she	186	“ I ’ve told you , those sorts of things do n’t work around Hogwarts . Come on , Harry , ”
203355	203364	203336	203336	she	186	“ let ’s try that Shield Charm again . ”
203683	203686	203688	203688	Harry	248	“ What ? ”
203697	203700	203702	203702	Hermione	186	“ Nothing , ”
203727	203738	203719	203719	He	196	“ No way . Not today . That old cow . ”
203739	203742	203744	203744	Harry	248	“ What ? ”
203746	203751	203744	203744	Harry	248	“ Rita Skeeter again ? ”
203752	203755	203757	203757	Ron	196	“ No , ”
203774	203784	203786	203786	Harry	248	“ It ’s about me , is n’t it ? ”
203788	203791	203793	203793	Ron	196	“ No , ”
203823	203851	203811	203812	Draco Malfoy	290	“ Hey , Potter ! Potter ! How ’s your head ? You feeling all right ? Sure you ’re not going to go berserk on us ? ”
203882	203888	203889	203889	Harry	162	“ Let me see it , ”
203894	203899	203889	203889	Harry	162	“ Give it here . ”
203929	203933	203927	203928	HARRY POTTER	162	“ DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS ”
204136	204143	204145	204146	one specialist	4429	“ He might even be pretending , ”
204148	204157	204145	204146	one specialist	4429	“ This could be a plea for attention . ”
204187	204193	204195	204196	Draco Malfoy	290	“ Potter can speak Parseltongue , ”
204203	204276	204195	204196	Draco Malfoy	290	“ There were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago , and most people thought Potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy . It was all hushed up , though . But he ’s made friends with werewolves and giants too . We think he ’d do anything for a bit of power . ”
204340	204381	204331	204331	he	4437	“ as worthy of investigation . Personally , I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes , as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic , and are historically associated with evildoers . ”
204384	204408	204331	204331	he	4437	“ anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence . ”
204458	204469	204471	204471	Harry	162	“ Gone off me a bit , has n’t she ? ”
204515	204526	204527	204527	Ron	196	“ How did she know your scar hurt in Divination ? ”
204530	204548	204527	204527	Ron	196	“ There ’s no way she was there , there ’s no way she could ’ve heard — ”
204549	204555	204557	204557	Harry	162	“ The window was open , ”
204559	204566	204557	204557	Harry	162	“ I opened it to breathe . ”
204567	204577	204578	204578	Hermione	186	“ You were at the top of North Tower ! ”
204581	204596	204578	204578	Hermione	186	“ Your voice could n’t have carried all the way down to the grounds ! ”
204597	204615	204617	204617	Harry	162	“ Well , you ’re the one who ’s supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging ! ”
204619	204628	204617	204617	Harry	162	“ You tell me how she did it ! ”
204629	204635	204637	204637	Hermione	186	“ I ’ve been trying ! ”
204639	204645	204637	204637	Hermione	186	“ But I … but … ”
204671	204677	204679	204679	Ron	196	“ Are you all right ? ”
204685	204688	204690	204690	Hermione	186	“ Yes , ”
204730	204737	204738	204738	Hermione	186	“ I ’ve had an idea , ”
204745	204810	204738	204738	Hermione	186	“ I think I know … because then no one would be able to see … even Moody … and she ’d have been able to get onto the window ledge … but she ’s not allowed … she ’s definitely not allowed … I think we ’ve got her ! Just give me two seconds in the library — just to make sure ! ”
204827	204830	204831	204831	Ron	196	“ Oi ! ”
204836	204851	204852	204852	he	196	“ We ’ve got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes ! Blimey , ”
204860	204891	204852	204852	he	196	“ she must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam . What ’re you going to do in Binns ’s class — read again ? ”
204929	204933	204934	204934	Harry	162	“ S’pose so , ”
204954	204970	204971	204971	she	194	“ Potter , the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after breakfast , ”
204974	204983	204985	204985	Harry	162	“ But the task ’s not till tonight ! ”
205002	205011	205012	205012	she	194	“ I ’m aware of that , Potter , ”
205015	205042	205012	205012	she	194	“ The champions ’ families are invited to watch the final task , you know . This is simply a chance for you to greet them . ”
205052	205066	205067	205067	he	162	“ She does n’t expect the Dursleys to turn up , does she ? ”
205072	205075	205077	205077	Ron	196	“ Dunno , ”
205079	205100	205077	205077	Ron	196	“ Harry , I ’d better hurry , I ’m going to be late for Binns . See you later . ”
205222	205234	205218	205218	his	247	“ Harry , come on , they ’re waiting for you ! ”
205367	205370	205371	205372	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Surprise ! ”
205385	205396	205397	205397	She	199	“ Thought we ’d come and watch you , Harry ! ”
205407	205412	205414	205414	Bill	219	“ You all right ? ”
205424	205447	205414	205414	Bill	219	“ Charlie wanted to come , but he could n’t get time off . He said you were incredible against the Horntail . ”
205484	205492	205493	205493	Harry	162	“ This is really nice of you , ”
205499	205509	205493	205493	Harry	162	“ I thought for a moment — the Dursleys — ”
205510	205513	205515	205516	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Hmm , ”
205545	205553	205555	205555	Bill	219	“ It ’s great being back here , ”
205578	205601	205562	205562	Violet	447	“ Have n’t seen this place for five years . Is that picture of the mad knight still around ? Sir Cadogan ? ”
205602	205606	205608	205608	Harry	162	“ Oh yeah , ”
205619	205625	205627	205627	Bill	219	“ And the Fat Lady ? ”
205629	205637	205639	205640	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ She was here in my time , ”
205642	205665	205639	205640	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ She gave me such a telling off one night when I got back to the dormitory at four in the morning — ”
205666	205681	205683	205683	Bill	219	“ What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning ? ”
205699	205711	205712	205712	she	199	“ Your father and I had been for a nighttime stroll , ”
205715	205739	205712	205712	she	199	“ He got caught by Apollyon Pringle — he was the caretaker in those days — your father ’s still got the marks . ”
205740	205749	205751	205751	Bill	219	“ Fancy giving us a tour , Harry ? ”
205753	205758	205760	205760	Harry	162	“ Yeah , okay , ”
205786	205794	205795	205795	he	239	“ There you are , are you ? ”
205804	205827	205795	205795	he	239	“ Bet you ’re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric ’s caught you up on points , are you ? ”
205828	205831	205833	205833	Harry	162	“ What ? ”
205835	205839	205841	205841	Cedric	247	“ Ignore him , ”
205854	205884	205841	205841	Cedric	247	“ He ’s been angry ever since Rita Skeeter ’s article about the Triwizard Tournament — you know , when she made out you were the only Hogwarts champion . ”
205885	205898	205900	205901	Amos Diggory	239	“ Did n’t bother to correct her , though , did he ? ”
205924	205943	205922	205922	Bill	219	“ Still … you ’ll show him , Ced . Beaten him once before , have n’t you ? ”
205944	205958	205959	205960	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble , Amos ! ”
205964	205979	205959	205960	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ I would have thought you ’d know that , working at the Ministry ! ”
206072	206077	206078	206078	Harry	162	“ How ’s Percy ? ”
206087	206091	206093	206093	Bill	219	“ Not good , ”
206095	206101	206103	206104	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ He ’s very upset , ”
206113	206193	206107	206107	her	199	“ The Ministry wants to keep Mr. Crouch ’s disappearance quiet , but Percy ’s been hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr. Crouch has been sending in . They seem to think there ’s a chance they were n’t genuinely written by him . Percy ’s been under a lot of strain . They ’re not letting him fill in for Mr. Crouch as the fifth judge tonight . Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it . ”
206202	206207	206209	206209	Ron	196	“ Mum — Bill ! ”
206221	206228	206209	206209	Ron	196	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
206229	206239	206241	206242	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Come to watch Harry in the last task ! ”
206245	206266	206241	206242	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ I must say , it makes a lovely change , not having to cook . How was your exam ? ”
206267	206272	206274	206274	Ron	196	“ Oh … okay , ”
206276	206298	206299	206299	he	196	“ Could n’t remember all the goblin rebels ’ names , so I invented a few . It ’s all right , ”
206315	206335	206310	206311	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ they ’re all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean ; it was n’t hard . ”
206405	206414	206396	206396	she	186	“ Are you going to tell us — ? ”
206426	206431	206433	206434	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Hello , Hermione , ”
206442	206445	206447	206447	Hermione	186	“ Hello , ”
206470	206497	206462	206462	Harry	248	“ Mrs. Weasley , you did n’t believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly , did you ? Because Hermione ’s not my girlfriend . ”
206498	206501	206503	206504	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Oh ! ”
206506	206515	206503	206504	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ No — of course I did n’t ! ”
206671	206720	206660	206660	his	195	“ Ladies and gentlemen , in five minutes ’ time , I will be asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament . Will the champions please follow Mr. Bagman down to the stadium now . ”
206762	206769	206770	206770	Bagman	230	“ Feeling all right , Harry ? ”
206783	206786	206770	206770	Bagman	230	“ Confident ? ”
206787	206792	206794	206794	Harry	248	“ I ’m okay , ”

207021	207055	207015	207016	Professor McGonagall	194	“ If you get into difficulty , and wish to be rescued , send red sparks into the air , and one of us will come and get you , do you understand ? ”
207060	207067	207069	207069	Bagman	230	“ Off you go , then ! ”
207076	207082	207083	207083	Hagrid	205	“ Good luck , Harry , ”

Tied in first place , with eighty - five points each — Mr. Cedric Diggory and Mr. Harry Potter , both of Hogwarts School ! ”
207200	207217	207241	207242	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ In second place , with eighty points — Mr. Viktor Krum , of Durmstrang Institute ! ”
207221	207235	207241	207242	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ And in third place — Miss Fleur Delacour , of Beauxbatons Academy ! ”

207289	207296	207287	207287	Bagman	230	“ Three — two — one — ”
207376	207379	207368	207368	He	162	“ Lumos , ”
207406	207410	207411	207411	Harry	162	“ See you , ”

209908	209947	209901	209901	she	764	“ Not unless you can answer my riddle . Answer on your first guess — I let you pass . Answer wrongly — I attack . Remain silent — I will let you walk away from me unscathed . ”
210005	210008	210009	210009	he	162	“ Okay , ”
210012	210019	210009	210009	he	162	“ Can I hear the riddle ? ”
210040	210050	210025	210025	her	4554	“ First think of the person who lives in disguise ,
210123	210123	210117	210117	you	4554	”
210129	210139	210140	210140	he	162	“ Could I have it again … more slowly ? ”
210156	210172	210173	210173	Harry	162	“ All the clues add up to a creature I would n’t want to kiss ? ”
210188	210191	210192	210192	Harry	162	“ yes . ”
210242	210248	210249	210249	Harry	162	“ A person in disguise , ”
210256	210301	210249	210249	Harry	162	“ who lies … er … that ’d be a — an imposter . No , that ’s not my guess ! A — a spy ? I ’ll come back to that … could you give me the next clue again , please ? ”
210311	210320	210321	210321	Harry	162	“ ‘ The last thing to mend , ’ ”
210324	210344	210321	210321	Harry	162	“ Er … no idea … ‘ middle of middle ’ … could I have the last bit again ? ”
210353	210372	210374	210374	Harry	162	“ ‘ The sound often heard during the search for a hard - to - find word , ’ ”
210376	210397	210374	210374	Harry	162	“ Er … that ’d be … er … hang on — ‘ er ’ ! Er ’s a sound ! ”

211234	211254	211228	211228	Cedric	247	“ You take it . You should win . That ’s twice you ’ve saved my neck in here . ”
211255	211266	211267	211267	Harry	162	“ That ’s not how it ’s supposed to work , ”
211319	211352	211308	211308	he	247	“ The one who reaches the cup first gets the points . That ’s you . I ’m telling you , I ’m not going to win any races on this leg . ”
211373	211376	211377	211377	he	247	“ No , ”
211380	211385	211387	211387	Harry	162	“ Stop being noble , ”
211390	211403	211387	211387	Harry	162	“ Just take it , then we can get out of here . ”
211416	211424	211425	211425	Cedric	247	“ You told me about the dragons , ”
211428	211448	211425	211425	Cedric	247	“ I would ’ve gone down in the first task if you had n’t told me what was coming . ”
211449	211457	211458	211458	Harry	162	“ I had help on that too , ”
211472	211484	211458	211458	Harry	162	“ You helped me with the egg — we ’re square . ”
211485	211497	211499	211499	Cedric	247	“ I had help on the egg in the first place , ”
211501	211507	211509	211509	Harry	162	“ We ’re still square , ”
211538	211550	211552	211552	Cedric	247	“ You should ’ve got more points on the second task , ”
211555	211571	211552	211552	Cedric	247	“ You stayed behind to get all the hostages . I should ’ve done that . ”
211572	211588	211590	211590	Harry	162	“ I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously ! ”
211593	211599	211590	211590	Harry	162	“ Just take the cup ! ”
211600	211603	211605	211605	Cedric	247	“ No , ”

211769	211772	211800	211800	Harry	162	“ What ? ”
211773	211796	211800	211800	Harry	162	“ We ’ll take it at the same time . It ’s still a Hogwarts victory . We ’ll tie for it . ”
211807	211813	211800	211800	Harry	162	“ You — you sure ? ”
211814	211817	211819	211819	Harry	162	“ Yeah , ”
211821	211847	211819	211819	Harry	162	“ Yeah … we ’ve helped each other out , have n’t we ? We both got here . Let ’s just take it together . ”
211871	211876	211877	211877	he	247	“ You ’re on , ”
211880	211884	211877	211877	he	247	“ Come here . ”
211926	211932	211934	211934	Harry	162	“ On three , right ? ”
211936	211943	211934	211934	Harry	162	“ One — two — three — ”
212044	212049	212050	212050	he	162	“ Where are we ? ”
212169	212180	212181	212181	he	247	“ Did anyone tell you the cup was a Portkey ? ”
212184	212187	212189	212189	Harry	162	“ Nope , ”
212206	212217	212191	212191	He	162	“ Is this supposed to be part of the task ? ”
212218	212222	212224	212224	Cedric	247	“ I dunno , ”
212231	212238	212226	212226	He	247	“ Wands out , d’you reckon ? ”
212239	212242	212244	212244	Harry	162	“ Yeah , ”
212284	212289	212290	212290	he	162	“ Someone ’s coming , ”
212549	212554	212540	212540	he	162	“ Kill the spare . ”
212571	212575	212540	212540	he	162	“ Avada Kedavra ! ”
212839	212842	212843	212843	he	162	“ You ! ”
213325	213328	213316	213316	Harry	162	“ Hurry ! ”
213349	213356	213366	213366	Wormtail	180	“ It is ready , Master . ”
213357	213360	213366	213366	Wormtail	180	“ Now … ”
213674	213689	213659	213659	He	180	“ Bone of the father , unknowingly given , you will renew your son ! ”
213780	213800	213773	213773	His	180	“ Flesh — of the servant — w - willingly given — you will — revive — your master . ”
213971	213989	213963	213963	Wormtail	180	“ B - blood of the enemy … forcibly taken … you will … resurrect your foe . ”
214303	214307	214309	214317	the high , cold voice from behind the steam	4605	“ Robe me , ”
214648	214652	214653	214653	he	180	“ My Lord … ”
214656	214667	214653	214653	he	180	“ my Lord … you promised … you did promise … ”
214668	214674	214676	214676	Voldemort	331	“ Hold out your arm , ”
214679	214688	214689	214689	He	180	“ Oh Master … thank you , Master … ”
214700	214707	214727	214727	he	331	“ The other arm , Wormtail . ”
214708	214715	214727	214727	he	331	“ Master , please … please … ”
214795	214800	214801	214801	he	331	“ It is back , ”
214805	214825	214801	214801	he	331	“ they will all have noticed it … and now , we shall see … now we shall know … ”
214906	214920	214921	214921	he	331	“ How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it ? ”
214933	214945	214921	214921	he	331	“ And how many will be foolish enough to stay away ? ”
214987	215002	215003	215003	he	331	“ You stand , Harry Potter , upon the remains of my late father , ”
215007	215060	215003	215003	he	331	“ A Muggle and a fool … very like your dear mother . But they both had their uses , did they not ? Your mother died to defend you as a child … and I killed my father , and see how useful he has proved himself , in death . … ”
215089	215144	215068	215068	he	331	“ You see that house upon the hillside , Potter ? My father lived there . My mother , a witch who lived here in this village , fell in love with him . But he abandoned her when she told him what she was . … He did n’t like magic , my father …
215145	215206	215208	215208	he	4612	“ He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born , Potter , and she died giving birth to me , leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage … but I vowed to find him … I revenged myself upon him , that fool who gave me his name … Tom Riddle . … ”
215220	215229	215230	215230	he	4612	“ Listen to me , reliving family history … ”
215234	215255	215230	215230	he	4612	“ why , I am growing quite sentimental . … But look , Harry ! My true family returns . … ”
215346	215351	215352	215352	he	4620	“ Master … Master … ”
215466	215472	215474	215474	Voldemort	331	“ Welcome , Death Eaters , ”
215477	215515	215474	215474	Voldemort	331	“ Thirteen years … thirteen years since last we met . Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday . … We are still united under the Dark Mark , then ! Or are we ? ”
215532	215537	215538	215538	he	331	“ I smell guilt , ”
215541	215552	215538	215538	he	331	“ There is a stench of guilt upon the air . ”
215580	215627	215538	215538	he	331	“ I see you all , whole and healthy , with your powers intact — such prompt appearances ! — and I ask myself … why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master , to whom they swore eternal loyalty ? ”
215651	215657	215659	215659	Voldemort	331	“ And I answer myself , ”
215661	215693	215659	215659	Voldemort	331	“ they must have believed me broken , they thought I was gone . They slipped back among my enemies , and they pleaded innocence , and ignorance , and bewitchment . …
215694	215755	215628	215629	No one	819	“ And then I ask myself , but how could they have believed I would not rise again ? They , who knew the steps I took , long ago , to guard myself against mortal death ? They , who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living ?
215756	215802	215845	215848	One of the men	4630	“ And I answer myself , perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist , one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort … perhaps they now pay allegiance to another … perhaps that champion of commoners , of Mudbloods and Muggles , Albus Dumbledore ? ”
215830	215844	215851	215851	himself	4630	“ It is a disappointment to me … I confess myself disappointed . … ”
215871	215874	215875	215875	he	4630	“ Master ! ”
215878	215888	215875	215875	he	4630	“ Master , forgive me ! Forgive us all ! ”
215899	215902	215896	215896	his	184	“ Crucio ! ”
215956	215962	215964	215964	Voldemort	184	“ Get up , Avery , ”
215967	216017	215964	215964	Voldemort	184	“ Stand up . You ask for forgiveness ? I do not forgive . I do not forget . Thirteen long years … I want thirteen years ’ repayment before I forgive you . Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already , have you not , Wormtail ? ”
216029	216064	216018	216018	He	184	“ You returned to me , not out of loyalty , but out of fear of your old friends . You deserve this pain , Wormtail . You know that , do n’t you ? ”
216065	216070	216072	216072	Wormtail	180	“ Yes , Master , ”
216074	216081	216072	216072	Wormtail	180	“ please , Master … please … ”
216082	216092	216094	216094	Voldemort	184	“ Yet you helped return me to my body , ”
216104	216124	216098	216098	Wormtail	180	“ Worthless and traitorous as you are , you helped me … and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers . … ”
216252	216256	216257	216257	he	180	“ My Lord , ”
216260	216274	216257	216257	he	180	“ Master … it is beautiful … thank you … thank you . … ”
216290	216300	216302	216302	Voldemort	184	“ May your loyalty never waver again , Wormtail , ”
216304	216315	216275	216275	He	180	“ No , my Lord … never , my Lord … ”
216351	216358	216359	216359	he	184	“ Lucius , my slippery friend , ”
216366	216448	216359	216359	he	184	“ I am told that you have not renounced the old ways , though to the world you present a respectable face . You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle - torture , I believe ? Yet you never tried to find me , Lucius . … Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun , I daresay … but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master ? ”
216449	216460	216462	216463	Lucius Malfoy	289	“ My Lord , I was constantly on the alert , ”
216472	216502	216462	216463	Lucius Malfoy	289	“ Had there been any sign from you , any whisper of your whereabouts , I would have been at your side immediately , nothing could have prevented me — ”
216503	216525	216527	216527	Voldemort	184	“ And yet you ran from my Mark , when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer ? ”
216537	216564	216531	216532	Mr. Malfoy	291	“ Yes , I know all about that , Lucius . … You have disappointed me . … I expect more faithful service in the future . ”
216565	216584	216462	216463	Lucius Malfoy	289	“ Of course , my Lord , of course . … You are merciful , thank you . … ”
216611	216618	216620	216620	Voldemort	184	“ The Lestranges should stand here , ”
216623	216700	216620	216620	Voldemort	184	“ But they are entombed in Azkaban . They were faithful . They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me . … When Azkaban is broken open , the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams . The dementors will join us … they are our natural allies … we will recall the banished giants … I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me , and an army of creatures whom all fear . … ”
216725	216759	216716	216716	he	184	“ Macnair … destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now , Wormtail tells me ? You shall have better victims than that soon , Macnair . Lord Voldemort will provide . … ”
216760	216769	216771	216771	Macnair	591	“ Thank you , Master … thank you , ”
216773	216776	216778	216778	Voldemort	184	“ And here ”
216788	216811	216778	216778	Voldemort	184	“ we have Crabbe … you will do better this time , will you not , Crabbe ? And you , Goyle ? ”
216819	216824	216778	216778	Voldemort	184	“ Yes , Master … ”
216825	216832	216778	216778	Voldemort	184	“ We will , Master . … ”
216833	216842	216847	216847	he	184	“ The same goes for you , Nott , ”
216859	216875	216778	216778	Voldemort	184	“ My Lord , I prostrate myself before you , I am your most faithful — ”
216876	216881	216883	216883	Voldemort	184	“ That will do , ”
216915	216978	216895	216895	he	184	“ And here we have six missing Death Eaters … three dead in my service . One , too cowardly to return … he will pay . One , who I believe has left me forever … he will be killed , of course … and one , who remains my most faithful servant , and who has already reentered my service . ”
216998	217022	216987	216987	their	5534	“ He is at Hogwarts , that faithful servant , and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight . …
217023	217026	217033	217033	his	184	“ Yes , ”
217048	217074	217033	217033	his	184	“ Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party . One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor . ”
217103	217136	217093	217094	Lucius Malfoy	289	“ Master , we crave to know … we beg you to tell us … how you have achieved this … this miracle … how you managed to return to us . … ”
217137	217148	217150	217150	Voldemort	184	“ Ah , what a story it is , Lucius , ”
217152	217166	217150	217150	Voldemort	184	“ And it begins — and ends — with my young friend here . ”
217198	217214	217215	217215	Voldemort	184	“ You know , of course , that they have called this boy my downfall ? ”
217239	217293	217233	217233	he	162	“ You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body , I tried to kill him . His mother died in the attempt to save him — and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen . … I could not touch the boy . ”
217312	217353	217298	217298	his	184	“ His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice . … This is old magic , I should have remembered it , I was foolish to overlook it … but no matter . I can touch him now . ”
217396	217578	217377	217377	Voldemort	184	“ I miscalculated , my friends , I admit it . My curse was deflected by the woman ’s foolish sacrifice , and it rebounded upon myself . Aaah … pain beyond pain , my friends ; nothing could have prepared me for it . I was ripped from my body , I was less than spirit , less than the meanest ghost … but still , I was alive . What I was , even I do not know … I , who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality . You know my goal — to conquer death . And now , I was tested , and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked … for I had not been killed , though the curse should have done it . Nevertheless , I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive , and without the means to help myself … for I had no body , and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand . …
217579	217655	217377	217377	Voldemort	184	“ I remember only forcing myself , sleeplessly , endlessly , second by second , to exist . … I settled in a faraway place , in a forest , and I waited . … Surely , one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me … one of them would come and perform the magic I could not , to restore me to a body … but I waited in vain . … ”
217678	217771	217377	217377	Voldemort	184	“ Only one power remained to me . I could possess the bodies of others . But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful , for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me . I sometimes inhabited animals — snakes , of course , being my preference — but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit , for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic … and my possession of them shortened their lives ; none of them lasted long . …
217772	217912	217377	217377	Voldemort	184	“ Then … four years ago … the means for my return seemed assured . A wizard — young , foolish , and gullible — wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home . Oh , he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of … for he was a teacher at Dumbledore ’s school … he was easy to bend to my will … he brought me back to this country , and after a while , I took possession of his body , to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders . But my plan failed . I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer ’s Stone . I was not to be assured immortal life . I was thwarted … thwarted , once again , by Harry Potter . … ”
217951	217973	217974	217974	Voldemort	184	“ The servant died when I left his body , and I was left as weak as ever I had been , ”
217977	218055	217974	217974	Voldemort	184	“ I returned to my hiding place far away , and I will not pretend to you that I did n’t then fear that I might never regain my powers . … Yes , that was perhaps my darkest hour … I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess … and I had given up hope , now , that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me . … ”
218075	218219	218070	218070	Voldemort	184	“ And then , not even a year ago , when I had almost abandoned hope , it happened at last … a servant returned to me . Wormtail here , who had faked his own death to escape justice , was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends , and decided to return to his master . He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding … helped , of course , by the rats he met along the way . Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats , do you not , Wormtail ? His filthy little friends told him there was a place , deep in an Albanian forest , that they avoided , where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them . …
218220	218286	217974	217974	Voldemort	184	“ But his journey back to me was not smooth , was it , Wormtail ? For , hungry one night , on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me , he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food … and who should he meet there , but one Bertha Jorkins , a witch from the Ministry of Magic .
218287	218387	218070	218070	Voldemort	184	“ Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort . This might have been the end of Wormtail , and of my last hope for regeneration . But Wormtail — displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him — convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll . He overpowered her … he brought her to me . And Bertha Jorkins , who might have ruined all , proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams … for — with a little persuasion — she became a veritable mine of information .
218388	218492	217974	217974	Voldemort	184	“ She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year . She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me , if I could only contact him . She told me many things … but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful , and when I had extracted all useful information from her , her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair . She had now served her purpose . I could not possess her . I disposed of her . ”
218506	218615	218616	218616	Voldemort	184	“ Wormtail ’s body , of course , was ill adapted for possession , as all assumed him dead , and would attract far too much attention if noticed . However , he was the able - bodied servant I needed , and , poor wizard though he is , Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him , which would return me to a rudimentary , weak body of my own , a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth … a spell or two of my own invention … a little help from my dear Nagini , ”
218627	218657	217974	217974	Voldemort	184	“ a potion concocted from unicorn blood , and the snake venom Nagini provided … I was soon returned to an almost human form , and strong enough to travel .
218658	218720	217974	217974	Voldemort	184	“ There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer ’s Stone anymore , for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed . But I was willing to embrace mortal life again , before chasing immortality . I set my sights lower … I would settle for my old body back again , and my old strength .
218721	218774	217974	217974	Voldemort	184	“ I knew that to achieve this — it is an old piece of Dark Magic , the potion that revived me tonight — I would need three powerful ingredients . Well , one of them was already at hand , was it not , Wormtail ? Flesh given by a servant . …
218775	218902	217974	217974	Voldemort	184	“ My father ’s bone , naturally , meant that we would have to come here , where he was buried . But the blood of a foe … Wormtail would have had me use any wizard , would you not , Wormtail ? Any wizard who had hated me … as so many of them still do . But I knew the one I must use , if I was to rise again , more powerful than I had been when I had fallen . I wanted Harry Potter ’s blood . I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago … for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too . …
218903	219061	217974	217974	Voldemort	184	“ But how to get at Harry Potter ? For he has been better protected than I think even he knows , protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago , when it fell to him to arrange the boy ’s future . Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic , to ensure the boy ’s protection as long as he is in his relations ’ care . Not even I can touch him there . … Then , of course , there was the Quidditch World Cup . … I thought his protection might be weaker there , away from his relations and Dumbledore , but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards . And then , the boy would return to Hogwarts , where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggle - loving fool from morning until night . So how could I take him ?
219062	219172	219185	219185	his	184	“ Why … by using Bertha Jorkins ’s information , of course . Use my one faithful Death Eater , stationed at Hogwarts , to ensure that the boy ’s name was entered into the Goblet of Fire . Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament — that he touched the Triwizard Cup first — the cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey , which would bring him here , beyond the reach of Dumbledore ’s help and protection , and into my waiting arms . And here he is … the boy you all believed had been my downfall . … ”
219188	219191	219183	219183	He	184	“ Crucio ! ”
219290	219314	219316	219316	Voldemort	184	“ You see , I think , how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me , ”
219318	219417	219418	219418	he	184	“ But I want there to be no mistake in anybody ’s mind . Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance . And I am now going to prove my power by killing him , here and now , in front of you all , when there is no Dumbledore to help him , and no mother to die for him . I will give him his chance . He will be allowed to fight , and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger . Just a little longer , Nagini , ”
219437	219451	219456	219456	Wormtail	180	“ Now untie him , Wormtail , and give him back his wand . ”
219621	219633	219638	219638	his	331	“ You have been taught how to duel , Harry Potter ? ”
219683	219685	219638	219638	his	331	“ Expelliarmus ”
219780	219789	219791	219791	Voldemort	331	“ We bow to each other , Harry , ”
219806	219832	219791	219791	Voldemort	331	“ Come , the niceties must be observed . … Dumbledore would like you to show manners . … Bow to death , Harry . … ”
219877	219883	219888	219888	his	331	“ I said , bow , ”
219919	219923	219930	219930	he	331	“ Very good , ”
219943	219966	219939	219939	Harry	162	“ And now you face me , like a man … straight - backed and proud , the way your father died . …
219967	219974	219930	219930	he	331	“ And now — we duel . ”
220115	220120	220122	220122	Voldemort	331	“ A little break , ”
220133	220160	220122	220122	Voldemort	331	“ a little pause … That hurt , did n’t it , Harry ? You do n’t want me to do that again , do you ? ”
220224	220237	220239	220239	Voldemort	331	“ I asked you whether you want me to do that again , ”
220242	220248	220239	220239	Voldemort	331	“ Answer me ! Imperio ! ”
220351	220355	220333	220333	I	0	“ I WON’T ! ”
220420	220425	220427	220427	Voldemort	331	“ You wo n’t ? ”
220439	220469	220431	220433	the Death Eaters	5534	“ You wo n’t say no ? Harry , obedience is a virtue I need to teach you before you die . … Perhaps another little dose of pain ? ”
220521	220534	220536	220536	Voldemort	331	“ We are not playing hide - and - seek , Harry , ”
220552	220619	220547	220549	the Death Eaters	331	“ You can not hide from me . Does this mean you are tired of our duel ? Does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now , Harry ? Come out , Harry … come out and play , then … it will be quick … it might even be painless … I would not know … I have never died . … ”
220775	220778	220772	220772	Harry	162	“ Expelliarmus ! ”
220782	220786	220779	220779	Voldemort	331	“ Avada Kedavra ! ”

221139	221147	221148	221148	Voldemort	331	“ Do nothing unless I command you ! ”

224656	224678	224575	224575	Harry	162	“ Karkaroff ’s gone ? He ran away ? But then — he did n’t put my name in the goblet ? ”

224789	224796	224797	224797	he	344	“ He forgave them , then ? ”
224800	224814	224797	224797	he	344	“ The Death Eaters who went free ? The ones who escaped Azkaban ? ”
224815	224818	224820	224820	Harry	162	“ What ? ”
224845	224850	224852	224852	Moody	344	“ I asked you , ”
224855	224920	224852	224852	Moody	344	“ whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him . Those treacherous cowards who would n’t even brave Azkaban for him . The faithless , worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup , but fled at the sight of the Dark Mark when I fired it into the sky . ”
224921	224932	224797	224797	he	344	“ You fired … What are you talking about … ? ”
224933	225001	225002	225002	Moody	344	“ I told you , Harry … I told you . If there ’s one thing I hate more than any other , it ’s a Death Eater who walked free . They turned their backs on my master when he needed them most . I expected him to punish them . I expected him to torture them . Tell me he hurt them , Harry . … ”
225013	225045	225002	225002	Moody	344	“ Tell me he told them that I , I alone remained faithful … prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all … you . ”
225046	225060	225002	225002	Moody	344	“ You did n’t … it — it ca n’t be you . … ”
225061	225134	225002	225002	Moody	344	“ Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire , under the name of a different school ? I did . Who frightened off every person I thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament ? I did . Who nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons ? I did . Who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon ? I did . ”
225160	225310	225151	225151	His	162	“ It has n’t been easy , Harry , guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion . I have had to use every ounce of cunning I possess , so that my hand would not be detectable in your success . Dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily . As long as you got into that maze , preferably with a decent head start — then , I knew , I would have a chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear . But I also had to contend with your stupidity . The second task … that was when I was most afraid we would fail . I was keeping watch on you , Potter . I knew you had n’t worked out the egg ’s clue , so I had to give you another hint — ”
225311	225316	225317	225317	Harry	162	“ You did n’t , ”
225321	225328	225317	225317	Harry	162	“ Cedric gave me the clue — ”
225329	225513	225151	225151	His	162	“ Who told Cedric to open it underwater ? I did . I trusted that he would pass the information on to you . Decent people are so easy to manipulate , Potter . I was sure Cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons , and so he did . But even then , Potter , even then you seemed likely to fail . I was watching all the time … all those hours in the library . Did n’t you realize that the book you needed was in your dormitory all along ? I planted it there early on , I gave it to the Longbottom boy , do n’t you remember ? Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean . It would have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed . I expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could for help . Longbottom would have told you in an instant . But you did not … you did not . … You have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all .
225514	225607	225317	225317	Harry	162	“ So what could I do ? Feed you information from another innocent source . You told me at the Yule Ball a house - elf called Dobby had given you a Christmas present . I called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning . I staged a loud conversation with Professor McGonagall about the hostages who had been taken , and whether Potter would think to use gillyweed . And your little elf friend ran straight to Snape ’s office and then hurried to find you . … ”
225637	225674	225608	225608	Moody	344	“ You were so long in that lake , Potter , I thought you had drowned . But luckily , Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility , and marked you high for it . I breathed again .
225675	225695	225697	225697	Moody	344	“ You had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight , of course , ”
225699	225755	225697	225697	Moody	344	“ I was patrolling around it , able to see through the outer hedges , able to curse many obstacles out of your way . I Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed . I put the Imperius Curse on Krum , so that he would finish Diggory and leave your path to the cup clear . ”
225849	225868	225870	225870	Moody	344	“ The Dark Lord did n’t manage to kill you , Potter , and he so wanted to , ”
225872	225938	225870	225870	Moody	344	“ Imagine how he will reward me when he finds I have done it for him . I gave you to him — the thing he needed above all to regenerate — and then I killed you for him . I will be honored beyond all other Death Eaters . I will be his dearest , his closest supporter … closer than a son . … ”
225972	225979	225981	225981	Moody	344	“ The Dark Lord and I , ”
225999	226064	225984	225984	he	344	“ have much in common . Both of us , for instance , had very disappointing fathers … very disappointing indeed . Both of us suffered the indignity , Harry , of being named after those fathers . And both of us had the pleasure … the very great pleasure … of killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the Dark Order ! ”
226065	226070	226071	226071	Harry	162	“ You ’re mad , ”
226080	226085	226071	226071	Harry	162	“ you ’re mad ! ”
226086	226092	226094	226094	Moody	344	“ Mad , am I ? ”
226101	226147	226096	226096	his	344	“ We ’ll see ! We ’ll see who ’s mad , now that the Dark Lord has returned , with me at his side ! He is back , Harry Potter , you did not conquer him — and now — I conquer you ! ”
226167	226170	226160	226160	his	162	“ Stupefy ! ”
226425	226431	226432	226432	she	194	“ Come along , Potter , ”
226451	226458	226445	226445	she	194	“ Come along … hospital wing … ”
226459	226462	226464	226464	Dumbledore	195	“ No , ”
226467	226485	226445	226445	she	194	“ Dumbledore , he ought to — look at him — he ’s been through enough tonight — ”
226486	226499	226501	226501	Dumbledore	195	“ He will stay , Minerva , because he needs to understand , ”
226504	226541	226501	226501	Dumbledore	195	“ Understanding is the first step to acceptance , and only with acceptance can there be recovery . He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight , and why . ”
226542	226545	226546	226546	Harry	162	“ Moody , ”
226559	226567	226549	226549	He	162	“ How can it have been Moody ? ”
226568	226575	226577	226577	Dumbledore	195	“ This is not Alastor Moody , ”
226580	226617	226577	226577	Dumbledore	195	“ You have never known Alastor Moody . The real Moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight . The moment he took you , I knew — and I followed . ”
226659	226735	226651	226651	he	195	“ Severus , please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess , and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the house - elf called Winky . Minerva , kindly go down to Hagrid ’s house , where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch . Take the dog up to my office , tell him I will be with him shortly , then come back here . ”
227021	227033	227034	227034	he	195	“ Stunned — controlled by the Imperius Curse — very weak , ”
227037	227079	227034	227034	he	195	“ Of course , they would have needed to keep him alive . Harry , throw down the imposter ’s cloak — he ’s freezing . Madam Pomfrey will need to see him , but he seems in no immediate danger . ”
227138	227144	227146	227146	Dumbledore	195	“ Polyjuice Potion , Harry , ”
227148	227207	227146	227146	Dumbledore	195	“ You see the simplicity of it , and the brilliance . For Moody never does drink except from his hip flask , he ’s well known for it . The imposter needed , of course , to keep the real Moody close by , so that he could continue making the potion . You see his hair … ”
227218	227274	227208	227208	Dumbledore	195	“ The imposter has been cutting it off all year , see where it is uneven ? But I think , in the excitement of tonight , our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have done … on the hour … every hour . … We shall see . ”
227526	227529	227530	227530	Snape	368	“ Crouch ! ”
227539	227543	227530	227530	Snape	368	“ Barty Crouch ! ”
227544	227548	227550	227551	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Good heavens , ”
227588	227601	227581	227581	she	286	“ Master Barty , Master Barty , what is you doing here ? ”
227613	227631	227602	227602	She	286	“ You is killed him ! You is killed him ! You is killed Master ’s son ! ”
227632	227640	227642	227642	Dumbledore	195	“ He is simply Stunned , Winky , ”
227644	227657	227642	227642	Dumbledore	195	“ Step aside , please . Severus , you have the potion ? ”
227769	227772	227757	227757	he	195	“ Rennervate . ”
227801	227807	227808	227808	Dumbledore	195	“ Can you hear me ? ”
227818	227821	227822	227822	he	1763	“ Yes , ”
227825	227834	227836	227836	Dumbledore	195	“ I would like you to tell us , ”
227839	227854	227836	227836	Dumbledore	195	“ how you came to be here . How did you escape from Azkaban ? ”
227874	227956	227855	227855	Crouch	248	“ My mother saved me . She knew she was dying . She persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her . He loved her as he had never loved me . He agreed . They came to visit me . They gave me a draft of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my mother ’s hairs . She took a draft of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my hairs . We took on each other ’s appearance . ”
227965	227985	227957	227957	Winky	286	“ Say no more , Master Barty , say no more , you is getting your father into trouble ! ”
228000	228048	227987	227987	Crouch	248	“ The dementors are blind . They sensed one healthy , one dying person entering Azkaban . They sensed one healthy , one dying person leaving it . My father smuggled me out , disguised as my mother , in case any prisoners were watching through their doors .
228049	228089	227987	227987	Crouch	248	“ My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban . She was careful to drink Polyjuice Potion until the end . She was buried under my name and bearing my appearance . Everyone believed her to be me . ”
228096	228113	228115	228115	Dumbledore	195	“ And what did your father do with you , when he had got you home ? ”
228118	228193	227987	227987	Crouch	248	“ Staged my mother ’s death . A quiet , private funeral . That grave is empty . The house - elf nursed me back to health . Then I had to be concealed . I had to be controlled . My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me . When I had recovered my strength , I thought only of finding my master … of returning to his service . ”
228194	228202	228204	228204	Dumbledore	195	“ How did your father subdue you ? ”
228206	228211	228212	228212	Crouch	248	“ The Imperius Curse , ”
228215	228272	228212	228212	Crouch	248	“ I was under my father ’s control . I was forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night . I was always with the house - elf . She was my keeper and caretaker . She pitied me . She persuaded my father to give me occasional treats . Rewards for my good behavior . ”
228273	228280	228282	228282	Winky	286	“ Master Barty , Master Barty , ”
228287	228303	228282	228282	Winky	286	“ You is n’t ought to tell them , we is getting in trouble . … ”
228304	228315	228317	228317	Dumbledore	195	“ Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive ? ”
228320	228333	228317	228317	Dumbledore	195	“ Did anyone know except your father and the house - elf ? ”
228334	228337	228339	228339	Crouch	248	“ Yes , ”
228346	228456	228339	228339	Crouch	248	“ A witch in my father ’s office . Bertha Jorkins . She came to the house with papers for my father ’s signature . He was not at home . Winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen , to me . But Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me . She came to investigate . She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility Cloak . My father arrived home . She confronted him . He put a very powerful Memory Charm on her to make her forget what she ’d found out . Too powerful . He said it damaged her memory permanently . ”
228457	228471	228473	228473	Winky	286	“ Why is she coming to nose into my master ’s private business ? ”
228475	228484	228473	228473	Winky	286	“ Why is n’t she leaving us be ? ”
228485	228494	228496	228496	Dumbledore	195	“ Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup , ”
228498	228506	228508	228508	Crouch	248	“ Winky talked my father into it , ”
228517	228604	228508	228508	Crouch	248	“ She spent months persuading him . I had not left the house for years . I had loved Quidditch . Let him go , she said . He will be in his Invisibility Cloak . He can watch . Let him smell fresh air for once . She said my mother would have wanted it . She told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom . She had not saved me for a life of imprisonment . He agreed in the end .
228605	228671	228473	228473	Winky	286	“ It was carefully planned . My father led me and Winky up to the Top Box early in the day . Winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father . I was to sit there , invisible . When everyone had left the box , we would emerge . Winky would appear to be alone . Nobody would ever know .
228672	228800	228508	228508	Crouch	248	“ But Winky did n’t know that I was growing stronger . I was starting to fight my father ’s Imperius Curse . There were times when I was almost myself again . There were brief periods when I seemed outside his control . It happened , there , in the Top Box . It was like waking from a deep sleep . I found myself out in public , in the middle of the match , and I saw , in front of me , a wand sticking out of a boy ’s pocket . I had not been allowed a wand since before Azkaban . I stole it . Winky did n’t know . Winky is frightened of heights . She had her face hidden . ”
228801	228809	228811	228811	Winky	286	“ Master Barty , you bad boy ! ”
228819	228826	228828	228828	Dumbledore	195	“ So you took the wand , ”
228830	228839	228828	228828	Dumbledore	195	“ and what did you do with it ? ”
228840	228848	228850	228850	Crouch	248	“ We went back to the tent , ”
228852	229069	228850	228850	Crouch	248	“ Then we heard them . We heard the Death Eaters . The ones who had never been to Azkaban . The ones who had never suffered for my master . They had turned their backs on him . They were not enslaved , as I was . They were free to seek him , but they did not . They were merely making sport of Muggles . The sound of their voices awoke me . My mind was clearer than it had been in years . I was angry . I had the wand . I wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master . My father had left the tent ; he had gone to free the Muggles . Winky was afraid to see me so angry . She used her own brand of magic to bind me to her . She pulled me from the tent , pulled me into the forest , away from the Death Eaters . I tried to hold her back . I wanted to return to the campsite . I wanted to show those Death Eaters what loyalty to the Dark Lord meant , and to punish them for their lack of it . I used the stolen wand to cast the Dark Mark into the sky .
229070	229106	228828	228828	Dumbledore	195	“ Ministry wizards arrived . They shot Stunning Spells everywhere . One of the spells came through the trees where Winky and I stood . The bond connecting us was broken . We were both Stunned .
229107	229185	228850	228850	Crouch	248	“ When Winky was discovered , my father knew I must be nearby . He searched the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there . He waited until the other Ministry members had left the forest . He put me back under the Imperius Curse and took me home . He dismissed Winky . She had failed him . She had let me acquire a wand . She had almost let me escape . ”
229194	229214	229215	229215	Crouch	248	“ Now it was just Father and I , alone in the house . And then … and then … ”
229232	229238	229229	229229	his	248	“ My master came for me .
229239	229406	229215	229215	Crouch	248	“ He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Wormtail . My master had found out that I was still alive . He had captured Bertha Jorkins in Albania . He had tortured her . She told him a great deal . She told him about the Triwizard Tournament . She told him the old Auror , Moody , was going to teach at Hogwarts . He tortured her until he broke through the Memory Charm my father had placed upon her . She told him I had escaped from Azkaban . She told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master . And so my master knew that I was still his faithful servant — perhaps the most faithful of all . My master conceived a plan , based upon the information Bertha had given him . He needed me . He arrived at our house near midnight . My father answered the door . ”
229444	229513	229437	229437	She	286	“ It was very quick . My father was placed under the Imperius Curse by my master . Now my father was the one imprisoned , controlled . My master forced him to go about his business as usual , to act as though nothing was wrong . And I was released . I awoke . I was myself again , alive as I had n’t been in years .
229514	229525	229527	229527	Dumbledore	195	“ And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do ? ”
229529	229635	229437	229437	She	286	“ He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him . I was ready . It was my dream , my greatest ambition , to serve him , to prove myself to him . He told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts . A servant who would guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing to do so . A servant who would watch over Harry Potter . Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup . Turn the cup into a Portkey , which would take the first person to touch it to my master . But first — ”
229636	229642	229644	229644	Dumbledore	195	“ You needed Alastor Moody , ”
229658	229899	229653	229653	his	195	“ Wormtail and I did it . We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand . We journeyed to his house . Moody put up a struggle . There was a commotion . We managed to subdue him just in time . Forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk . Took some of his hair and added it to the potion . I drank it ; I became Moody ’s double . I took his leg and his eye . I was ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance . I made the dustbins move around the yard . I told Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard , who had set off the dustbins . Then I packed up Moody ’s clothes and Dark detectors , put them in the trunk with Moody , and set off for Hogwarts . I kept him alive , under the Imperius Curse . I wanted to be able to question him . To find out about his past , learn his habits , so that I could fool even Dumbledore . I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion . The other ingredients were easy . I stole boom - slang skin from the dungeons . When the Potions master found me in his office , I said I was under orders to search it . ”
229900	229911	229913	229913	Dumbledore	195	“ And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody ? ”
229915	229938	229653	229653	his	195	“ Wormtail returned to care for my master , in my father ’s house , and to keep watch over my father . ”
229939	229945	229947	229947	Dumbledore	195	“ But your father escaped , ”
229949	230065	229653	229653	his	195	“ Yes . After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done . There were periods when he knew what was happening . My master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house . He forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead . He made him write and say he was ill . But Wormtail neglected his duty . He was not watchful enough . My father escaped . My master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts . My father was going to tell Dumbledore everything , to confess . He was going to admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban .
230066	230113	229653	229653	his	195	“ My master sent me word of my father ’s escape . He told me to stop him at all costs . So I waited and watched . I used the map I had taken from Harry Potter . The map that had almost ruined everything . ”
230114	230117	230119	230119	Dumbledore	195	“ Map ? ”
230122	230128	230119	230119	Dumbledore	195	“ What map is this ? ”
230129	230198	229653	229653	his	195	“ Potter ’s map of Hogwarts . Potter saw me on it . Potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape ’s office one night . He thought I was my father . We have the same first name . I took the map from Potter that night . I told him my father hated Dark wizards . Potter believed my father was after Snape .
230199	230287	230119	230119	Dumbledore	195	“ For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts . At last , one evening , the map showed my father entering the grounds . I pulled on my Invisibility Cloak and went down to meet him . He was walking around the edge of the forest . Then Potter came , and Krum . I waited . I could not hurt Potter ; my master needed him . Potter ran to get Dumbledore . I Stunned Krum . I killed my father . ”
230288	230291	230293	230293	Winky	286	“ Noooo ! ”
230295	230307	230293	230293	Winky	286	“ Master Barty , Master Barty , what is you saying ? ”
230308	230314	230315	230315	Dumbledore	195	“ You killed your father , ”
230324	230333	230315	230315	Dumbledore	195	“ What did you do with the body ? ”
230334	230409	230119	230119	Dumbledore	195	“ Carried it into the forest . Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak . I had the map with me . I watched Potter run into the castle . He met Snape . Dumbledore joined them . I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle . I walked back out of the forest , doubled around behind them , went to meet them . I told Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come .
230410	230474	230315	230315	Dumbledore	195	“ Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father . I went back to my father ’s body . Watched the map . When everyone was gone , I Transfigured my father ’s body . He became a bone … I buried it , while wearing the Invisibility Cloak , in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid ’s cabin . ”
230492	230496	230489	230489	Dumbledore	597	“ And tonight … ”
230497	230511	230513	230514	Barty Crouch	278	“ I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner , ”
230516	230547	230513	230514	Barty Crouch	278	“ Turned it into a Portkey . My master ’s plan worked . He is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards . ”
230631	230648	230625	230625	He	597	“ Minerva , could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs ? ”
230649	230653	230655	230656	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Of course , ”
230694	230696	230698	230698	Dumbledore	597	“ Severus ”
230703	230772	230698	230698	Dumbledore	597	“ please tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here ; we need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing . Then go down into the grounds , find Cornelius Fudge , and bring him up to this office . He will undoubtedly want to question Crouch himself . Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour ’s time if he needs me . ”
230783	230786	230787	230787	Dumbledore	597	“ Harry ? ”
230846	230860	230861	230861	he	597	“ I want you to come up to my office first , Harry , ”
230871	230879	230861	230861	he	597	“ Sirius is waiting for us there . ”
231002	231005	231006	231006	Harry	162	“ Professor , ”
231009	231017	231006	231006	Harry	162	“ where are Mr. and Mrs. Diggory ? ”
231018	231025	231027	231027	Dumbledore	597	“ They are with Professor Sprout , ”
231052	231066	231029	231029	His	597	“ She was Head of Cedric ’s house , and knew him best . ”
231135	231156	231129	231129	he	597	“ Harry , are you all right ? I knew it — I knew something like this — what happened ? ”
231173	231177	231178	231178	he	597	“ What happened ? ”
231267	231273	231275	231275	Harry	162	“ ’ Lo , Fawkes , ”
231348	231366	231368	231368	Dumbledore	597	“ I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze , Harry , ”
231370	231384	231386	231386	Sirius	202	“ We can leave that till morning , ca n’t we , Dumbledore ? ”
231399	231410	231389	231389	He	202	“ Let him have a sleep . Let him rest . ”
231450	231459	231460	231460	Dumbledore	597	“ If I thought I could help you , ”
231464	231550	231460	231460	Dumbledore	597	“ by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight , I would do it . But I know better . Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it . You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you . I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time . I ask you to tell us what happened . ”
231822	231840	231841	231841	Harry	162	“ He said my blood would make him stronger than if he ’d used someone else ’s , ”
231845	231882	231843	231843	Dumbledore	597	“ He said the protection my — my mother left in me — he ’d have it too . And he was right — he could touch me without hurting himself , he touched my face . ”
231940	231944	231945	231945	he	162	“ Very well , ”
231952	231966	231945	231945	he	162	“ Voldemort has overcome that particular barrier . Harry , continue , please . ”
232096	232101	232102	232102	he	202	“ The wands connected ? ”
232111	232114	232102	232102	he	202	“ Why ? ”
232131	232135	232136	232136	he	597	“ Priori Incantatem , ”
232160	232166	232168	232168	Sirius	202	“ The Reverse Spell effect ? ”
232171	232174	232176	232176	Dumbledore	597	“ Exactly , ”
232178	232209	232210	232210	he	597	“ Harry ’s wand and Voldemort ’s wand share cores . Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix . This phoenix , in fact , ”
232232	232241	232242	232242	Harry	162	“ My wand ’s feather came from Fawkes ? ”
232247	232250	232252	232252	Dumbledore	597	“ Yes , ”
232254	232278	232252	232252	Dumbledore	597	“ Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand , the moment you left his shop four years ago . ”
232279	232290	232292	232292	Sirius	202	“ So what happens when a wand meets its brother ? ”
232294	232304	232306	232306	Dumbledore	597	“ They will not work properly against each other , ”
232308	232364	232306	232306	Dumbledore	597	“ If , however , the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle … a very rare effect will take place . One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed — in reverse . The most recent first … and then those which preceded it . … ”
232375	232379	232381	232381	Dumbledore	597	“ Which means , ”
232391	232401	232384	232384	his	597	“ that some form of Cedric must have reappeared . ”
232406	232413	232415	232415	Sirius	202	“ Diggory came back to life ? ”
232418	232426	232428	232428	Dumbledore	597	“ No spell can reawaken the dead , ”
232431	232463	232428	232428	Dumbledore	597	“ All that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo . A shadow of the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand … am I correct , Harry ? ”
232464	232470	232471	232471	Harry	162	“ He spoke to me , ”
232480	232494	232474	232474	He	162	“ The … the ghost Cedric , or whatever he was , spoke . ”
232495	232499	232501	232501	Dumbledore	597	“ An echo , ”
232503	232529	232501	232501	Dumbledore	597	“ which retained Cedric ’s appearance and character . I am guessing other such forms appeared … less recent victims of Voldemort ’s wand . … ”
232530	232535	232536	232536	Harry	162	“ An old man , ”
232544	232550	232536	232536	Harry	162	“ Bertha Jorkins . And … ”
232551	232555	232557	232557	Dumbledore	597	“ Your parents ? ”
232560	232563	232565	232565	Harry	162	“ Yes , ”
232582	232590	232592	232592	Dumbledore	597	“ The last murders the wand performed , ”
232596	232631	232592	232592	Dumbledore	597	“ In reverse order . More would have appeared , of course , had you maintained the connection . Very well , Harry , these echoes , these shadows … what did they do ? ”
232772	232779	232781	232781	Dumbledore	597	“ I will say it again , ”
232799	232903	232781	232781	Dumbledore	597	“ You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you tonight , Harry . You have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting Voldemort at the height of his powers . You have shouldered a grown wizard ’s burden and found yourself equal to it — and you have now given us all that we have a right to expect . You will come with me to the hospital wing . I do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight . A Sleeping Potion , and some peace … Sirius , would you like to stay with him ? ”
233012	233018	233002	233003	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Harry ! Oh Harry ! ”
233032	233035	233036	233036	he	597	“ Molly , ”
233044	233096	233097	233097	he	597	“ please listen to me for a moment . Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight . He has just had to relive it for me . What he needs now is sleep , and peace , and quiet . If he would like you all to stay with him , ”
233111	233138	233097	233097	he	597	“ you may do so . But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer , and certainly not this evening . ”
233167	233176	233148	233148	She	199	“ Did you hear ? He needs quiet ! ”
233177	233180	233182	233183	Madam Pomfrey	334	“ Headmaster , ”
233195	233202	233182	233183	Madam Pomfrey	334	“ may I ask what — ? ”
233203	233215	233217	233217	Dumbledore	597	“ This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while , ”
233220	233242	233217	233217	Dumbledore	597	“ I assure you , he is extremely well trained . Harry — I will wait while you get into bed . ”
233299	233318	233320	233320	Dumbledore	597	“ I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge , Harry , ”
233322	233339	233340	233340	He	162	“ I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the school . ”
233386	233391	233392	233392	Harry	162	“ Is he okay ? ”
233395	233401	233403	233404	Madam Pomfrey	334	“ He ’ll be fine , ”
233476	233482	233483	233483	he	162	“ I ’m all right , ”
233487	233491	233483	233483	he	162	“ Just tired . ”
233530	233542	233543	233543	she	334	“ You ’ll need to drink all of this , Harry , ”
233546	233555	233543	233543	she	334	“ It ’s a potion for dreamless sleep . ”
233703	233715	233738	233738	Someone	908	“ They ’ll wake him if they do n’t shut up ! ”
233716	233732	233738	233738	Someone	908	“ What are they shouting about ? Nothing else can have happened , can it ? ”
233765	233772	233773	233773	she	199	“ That ’s Fudge ’s voice , ”
233776	233795	233773	233773	she	199	“ And that ’s Minerva McGonagall ’s , is n’t it ? But what are they arguing about ? ”
233812	233822	233800	233800	them	4816	“ Regrettable , but all the same , Minerva — ”
233829	233840	233842	233843	Professor McGonagall	194	“ You should never have brought it inside the castle ! ”
233845	233851	233842	233843	Professor McGonagall	194	“ When Dumbledore finds out — ”
233911	233916	233917	233917	Fudge	288	“ Where ’s Dumbledore ? ”
233923	233929	233931	233932	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ He ’s not here , ”
233935	233954	233931	233932	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ This is a hospital wing , Minister , do n’t you think you ’d do better to — ”
233968	233973	233975	233975	Dumbledore	597	“ What has happened ? ”
233985	234011	233982	233983	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Why are you disturbing these people ? Minerva , I ’m surprised at you — I asked you to stand guard over Barty Crouch — ”
234012	234026	234027	234027	she	194	“ There is no need to stand guard over him anymore , Dumbledore ! ”
234030	234038	234027	234027	she	194	“ The Minister has seen to that ! ”
234074	234093	234095	234095	Snape	597	“ When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight ’s events , ”
234102	234138	234095	234095	Snape	597	“ he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question . He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle . He brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch — ”
234139	234150	234151	234152	Professor McGonagall	194	“ I told him you would not agree , Dumbledore ! ”
234155	234173	234151	234152	Professor McGonagall	194	“ I told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle , but — ”
234174	234179	234181	234181	Fudge	574	“ My dear woman ! ”
234194	234218	234181	234181	Fudge	574	“ as Minister of Magic , it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous — ”
234228	234239	234240	234240	she	194	“ The moment that — that thing entered the room , ”
234251	234261	234240	234240	she	194	“ it swooped down on Crouch and — and — ”
234327	234337	234339	234339	Fudge	574	“ By all accounts , he is no loss ! ”
234341	234352	234339	234339	Fudge	574	“ It seems he has been responsible for several deaths ! ”
234353	234364	234366	234366	Dumbledore	597	“ But he can not now give testimony , Cornelius , ”
234385	234398	234368	234368	He	597	“ He can not give evidence about why he killed those people . ”
234399	234415	234417	234417	Fudge	288	“ Why he killed them ? Well , that ’s no mystery , is it ? ”
234419	234454	234417	234417	Fudge	288	“ He was a raving lunatic ! From what Minerva and Severus have told me , he seems to have thought he was doing it all on You - Know - Who ’s instructions ! ”
234455	234465	234466	234466	Dumbledore	597	“ Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions , Cornelius , ”
234469	234502	234466	234466	Dumbledore	597	“ Those people ’s deaths were mere by - products of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again . The plan succeeded . Voldemort has been restored to his body . ”
234550	234566	234540	234540	He	288	“ You - Know - Who … returned ? Preposterous . Come now , Dumbledore … ”
234567	234577	234579	234579	Dumbledore	597	“ As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you , ”
234581	234647	234579	234579	Dumbledore	597	“ we heard Barry Crouch confess . Under the influence of Veritaserum , he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban , and how Voldemort — learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins — went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry . The plan worked , I tell you . Crouch has helped Voldemort to return . ”
234648	234654	234656	234656	Fudge	288	“ See here , Dumbledore , ”
234672	234728	234669	234669	his	288	“ you — you ca n’t seriously believe that . You - Know - Who — back ? Come now , come now … certainly , Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon You - Know - Who ’s orders — but to take the word of a lunatic like that , Dumbledore … ”
234729	234745	234747	234747	Dumbledore	597	“ When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight , he was transported straight to Voldemort , ”
234750	234774	234747	234747	Dumbledore	597	“ He witnessed Lord Voldemort ’s rebirth . I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office . ”
234794	234808	234775	234775	Dumbledore	597	“ I am afraid I can not permit you to question Harry tonight . ”
234830	234850	234815	234815	He	288	“ You are — er — prepared to take Harry ’s word on this , are you , Dumbledore ? ”
234879	234886	234888	234888	Dumbledore	597	“ Certainly , I believe Harry , ”
234896	234938	234890	234890	His	597	“ I heard Crouch ’s confession , and I heard Harry ’s account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup ; the two stories make sense , they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer . ”
234959	234986	234952	234952	he	288	“ You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned , on the word of a lunatic murderer , and a boy who … well … ”
234998	235009	235010	235010	he	288	“ You ’ve been reading Rita Skeeter , Mr. Fudge , ”
235051	235057	235058	235058	he	574	“ And if I have ? ”
235065	235097	235058	235058	he	574	“ If I have discovered that you ’ve been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet ? A Parselmouth , eh ? And having funny turns all over the place — ”
235098	235116	235118	235118	Dumbledore	597	“ I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar ? ”
235121	235134	235136	235136	Fudge	574	“ You admit that he has been having these pains , then ? ”
235139	235148	235136	235136	Fudge	574	“ Headaches ? Nightmares ? Possibly — hallucinations ? ”
235149	235156	235158	235158	Dumbledore	597	“ Listen to me , Cornelius , ”
235190	235227	235187	235188	young Crouch	511	“ Harry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains . I believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by , or feeling particularly murderous . ”
235245	235270	235239	235239	he	288	“ You ’ll forgive me , Dumbledore , but I ’ve never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before . … ”
235271	235280	235281	235281	Harry	162	“ Look , I saw Voldemort come back ! ”
235300	235317	235294	235295	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ I saw the Death Eaters ! I can give you their names ! Lucius Malfoy — ”
235339	235344	235346	235346	Fudge	288	“ Malfoy was cleared ! ”
235351	235362	235346	235346	Fudge	288	“ A very old family — donations to excellent causes — ”
235363	235366	235367	235367	Harry	162	“ Macnair ! ”
235370	235380	235346	235346	Fudge	288	“ Also cleared ! Now working for the Ministry ! ”
235381	235390	235346	235346	Fudge	288	“ Avery — Nott — Crabbe — Goyle — ”
235391	235411	235413	235413	Fudge	288	“ You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago ! ”
235416	235483	235413	235413	Fudge	288	“ You could have found those names in old reports of the trials ! For heaven ’s sake , Dumbledore — the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too — his tales are getting taller , and you ’re still swallowing them — the boy can talk to snakes , Dumbledore , and you still think he ’s trustworthy ? ”
235484	235488	235489	235490	Professor McGonagall	194	“ You fool ! ”
235493	235511	235489	235490	Professor McGonagall	194	“ Cedric Diggory ! Mr. Crouch ! These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic ! ”
235512	235521	235523	235523	Fudge	288	“ I see no evidence to the contrary ! ”
235534	235561	235530	235530	his	288	“ It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years ! ”
235634	235639	235640	235640	Dumbledore	597	“ Voldemort has returned , ”
235643	235686	235640	235640	Dumbledore	597	“ If you accept that fact straightaway , Fudge , and take the necessary measures , we may still be able to save the situation . The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors — ”
235687	235690	235692	235692	Fudge	288	“ Preposterous ! ”
235695	235733	235692	235692	Fudge	288	“ Remove the dementors ? I ’d be kicked out of office for suggesting it ! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban ! ”
235734	235774	235776	235776	Dumbledore	597	“ The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds , Cornelius , knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort ’s most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them ! ”
235778	235840	235776	235776	Dumbledore	597	“ They will not remain loyal to you , Fudge ! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can ! With the dementors behind him , and his old supporters returned to him , you will be hard - pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago ! ”
235857	235869	235870	235870	Dumbledore	597	“ The second step you must take — and at once , ”
235874	235883	235870	235870	Dumbledore	597	“ is to send envoys to the giants . ”
235884	235890	235891	235891	Fudge	288	“ Envoys to the giants ? ”
235899	235905	235891	235891	Fudge	288	“ What madness is this ? ”
235906	235922	235924	235924	Dumbledore	597	“ Extend them the hand of friendship , now , before it is too late , ”
235926	235952	235924	235924	Dumbledore	597	“ or Voldemort will persuade them , as he did before , that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom ! ”
235953	235962	235963	235963	Fudge	288	“ You — you can not be serious ! ”
235975	236000	235967	235967	his	288	“ If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants — people hate them , Dumbledore — end of my career — ”
236001	236006	236008	236008	Dumbledore	597	“ You are blinded , ”
236029	236183	236023	236023	his	597	“ by the love of the office you hold , Cornelius ! You place too much importance , and you always have done , on the so - called purity of blood ! You fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born , but what they grow to be ! Your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a pure - blood family as old as any — and see what that man chose to make of his life ! I tell you now — take the steps I have suggested , and you will be remembered , in office or out , as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic we have ever known . Fail to act — and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild ! ”
236184	236187	236189	236189	Fudge	288	“ Insane , ”
236195	236198	236189	236189	Fudge	288	“ Mad … ”
236254	236272	236274	236274	Dumbledore	597	“ If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this , Cornelius , ”
236276	236305	236274	236274	Dumbledore	597	“ we have reached a parting of the ways . You must act as you see fit . And I — I shall act as I see fit . ”
236337	236345	236346	236346	he	597	“ Now , see here , Dumbledore , ”
236354	236430	236346	236346	he	597	“ I ’ve given you free rein , always . I ’ve had a lot of respect for you . I might not have agreed with some of your decisions , but I ’ve kept quiet . There are n’t many who ’d have let you hire werewolves , or keep Hagrid , or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry . But if you ’re going to work against me — ”
236431	236442	236444	236444	Dumbledore	597	“ The only one against whom I intend to work , ”
236446	236468	236444	236444	Dumbledore	597	“ is Lord Voldemort . If you are against him , then we remain , Cornelius , on the same side . ”
236516	236531	236503	236503	he	288	“ He ca n’t be back , Dumbledore , he just ca n’t be … ”
236565	236568	236570	236570	Snape	597	“ There , ”
236573	236725	236570	236570	Snape	597	“ There . The Dark Mark . It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago , when it burned black , but you can still see it . Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord . It was a means of distinguishing one another , and his means of summoning us to him . When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater , we were to Disapparate , and Apparate , instantly , at his side . This Mark has been growing clearer all year . Karkaroff ’s too . Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight ? We both felt the Mark burn . We both knew he had returned . Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord ’s vengeance . He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold . ”
236775	236830	236753	236753	He	288	“ I do n’t know what you and your staff are playing at , Dumbledore , but I have heard enough . I have no more to add . I will be in touch with you tomorrow , Dumbledore , to discuss the running of this school . I must return to the Ministry . ”
236858	236862	236863	236863	he	597	“ Your winnings , ”
236886	236904	236863	236863	he	597	“ One thousand Galleons . There should have been a presentation ceremony , but under the circumstances … ”
236944	236952	236953	236953	he	597	“ There is work to be done , ”
236956	236973	236953	236953	he	597	“ Molly … am I right in thinking that I can count on you and Arthur ? ”
236974	236980	236993	236993	she	199	“ Of course you can , ”
236997	237031	236993	236993	she	199	“ We know what Fudge is . It ’s Arthur ’s fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all these years . Fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride . ”
237032	237043	237045	237045	Dumbledore	597	“ Then I need to send a message to Arthur , ”
237047	237081	237045	237045	Dumbledore	597	“ All those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately , and he is well placed to contact those at the Ministry who are not as shortsighted as Cornelius . ”
237082	237089	237091	237091	Bill	219	“ I ’ll go to Dad , ”
237096	237102	237091	237091	Bill	219	“ I ’ll go now . ”
237103	237106	237108	237108	Dumbledore	597	“ Excellent , ”
237110	237148	237108	237108	Dumbledore	597	“ Tell him what has happened . Tell him I will be in direct contact with him shortly . He will need to be discreet , however . If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry — ”
237149	237155	237157	237157	Bill	219	“ Leave it to me , ”
237187	237190	237192	237192	Dumbledore	597	“ Minerva , ”
237199	237225	237192	237192	Dumbledore	597	“ I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible . Also — if she will consent to come — Madame Maxime . ”
237235	237238	237239	237239	Dumbledore	597	“ Poppy , ”
237245	237301	237239	237239	Dumbledore	597	“ would you be very kind and go down to Professor Moody ’s office , where I think you will find a house - elf called Winky in considerable distress ? Do what you can for her , and take her back to the kitchens . I think Dobby will look after her for us . ”
237302	237308	237310	237311	Madam Pomfrey	334	“ Very — very well , ”
237345	237349	237350	237350	he	597	“ And now , ”
237353	237381	237350	237350	he	597	“ it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are . Sirius … if you could resume your usual form . ”
237413	237417	237418	237418	she	199	“ Sirius Black ! ”
237425	237431	237432	237432	Ron	196	“ Mum , shut up ! ”
237435	237440	237432	237432	Ron	196	“ It ’s okay ! ”
237463	237466	237467	237467	he	597	“ Him ! ”
237480	237487	237472	237472	Sirius	606	“ What is he doing here ? ”
237488	237496	237498	237498	Dumbledore	597	“ He is here at my invitation , ”
237504	237532	237498	237498	Dumbledore	597	“ as are you , Severus . I trust you both . It is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other . ”
237555	237565	237567	237567	Dumbledore	597	“ I will settle , in the short term , ”
237578	237627	237575	237575	his	597	“ for a lack of open hostility . You will shake hands . You are on the same side now . Time is short , and unless the few of us who know the truth do not stand united , there is no hope for any of us . ”
237664	237674	237676	237676	Dumbledore	597	“ That will do to be going on with , ”
237684	237747	237676	237676	Dumbledore	597	“ Now I have work for each of you . Fudge ’s attitude , though not unexpected , changes everything . Sirius , I need you to set off at once . You are to alert Remus Lupin , Arabella Figg , Mundungus Fletcher — the old crowd . Lie low at Lupins for a while ; I will contact you there . ”
237748	237751	237753	237753	Harry	248	“ But — ”
237774	237784	237786	237786	Sirius	606	“ You ’ll see me very soon , Harry , ”
237792	237812	237786	237786	Sirius	606	“ I promise you . But I must do what I can , you understand , do n’t you ? ”
237813	237816	237818	237818	Harry	248	“ Yeah , ”
237820	237828	237818	237818	Harry	248	“ Yeah … of course I do . ”
237870	237873	237875	237875	Dumbledore	597	“ Severus , ”
237881	237902	237875	237875	Dumbledore	597	“ you know what I must ask you to do . If you are ready … if you are prepared … ”
237903	237907	237909	237909	Snape	445	“ I am , ”
237927	237932	237934	237934	Dumbledore	597	“ Then good luck , ”
237965	237971	237972	237972	he	597	“ I must go downstairs , ”
237976	238000	237972	237972	he	597	“ I must see the Diggorys . Harry — take the rest of your potion . I will see all of you later . ”
238034	238048	238049	238050	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ You ’ve got to take the rest of your potion , Harry , ”
238076	238106	238067	238067	she	199	“ You have a good long sleep . Try and think about something else for a while … think about what you ’re going to buy with your winnings ! ”
238107	238115	238117	238117	Harry	248	“ I do n’t want that gold , ”
238123	238147	238117	238117	Harry	248	“ You have it . Anyone can have it . I should n’t have won it . It should ’ve been Cedric ’s . ”
238199	238208	238209	238210	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ It was n’t your fault , Harry , ”
238213	238224	238226	238226	Harry	248	“ I told him to take the cup with me , ”
238389	238392	238393	238393	she	186	“ Sorry , ”
238396	238402	238404	238405	Mrs. Weasley	199	“ Your potion , Harry , ”
238566	238573	238574	238574	she	598	“ He suffered very little then , ”
238587	238610	238574	238574	she	598	“ And after all , Amos … he died just when he ’d won the tournament . He must have been happy . ”
238626	238634	238618	238618	she	598	“ You look after yourself , now . ”
238646	238651	238652	238652	he	248	“ You take this , ”
238657	238674	238652	238652	he	248	“ It should ’ve been Cedric ’s , he got there first , you take it — ”
238682	238700	238676	238676	she	598	“ Oh no , it ’s yours , dear , I could n’t … you keep it . ”
238944	238960	238961	238961	he	248	“ She went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer , ”
238964	238981	238961	238961	he	248	“ But he wants you to go back to the Dursleys , at least at first . ”
238982	238985	238987	238987	Harry	248	“ Why ? ”
238989	238998	239000	239000	Ron	196	“ She said Dumbledore ’s got his reasons , ”
239007	239021	239003	239003	his	196	“ I suppose we ’ve got to trust him , have n’t we ? ”
239102	239107	239109	239109	Hagrid	205	“ Who ’s that ? ”
239116	239119	239109	239109	Hagrid	205	“ Harry ! ”
239143	239156	239120	239120	He	205	“ Good ter see yeh , mate . Good ter see yeh . ”
239182	239190	239191	239191	Hagrid	205	“ Bin havin’ a cuppa with Olympe , ”

239202	239205	239207	239207	Ron	196	“ Who ? ”
239210	239218	239220	239220	Hagrid	205	“ Madame Maxime , o ’ course ! ”
239222	239231	239233	239233	Ron	196	“ You two made up , have you ? ”
239235	239243	239245	239245	Hagrid	205	“ Dunno what yeh’re talkin ’ about , ”
239286	239292	239293	239293	he	205	“ You all righ ’ ? ”
239297	239300	239302	239302	Harry	248	“ Yeah , ”
239304	239310	239312	239312	Hagrid	205	“ No , yeh’re not , ”
239314	239325	239312	239312	Hagrid	205	“ ’ Course yeh’re not . But yeh will be . ”
239330	239339	239341	239341	Hagrid	205	“ Knew he was goin’ ter come back , ”
239357	239445	239349	239349	Hermione	186	“ Known it fer years , Harry . Knew he was out there , bidin ’ his time . It had ter happen . Well , now it has , an ’ we ’ll jus ’ have ter get on with it . We ’ll fight . Migh ’ be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold . That ’s Dumbledore ’s plan , anyway . Great man , Dumbledore . ’S long as we ’ve got him , I ’m not too worried . ”
239459	239470	239471	239471	he	205	“ No good sittin ’ worryin ’ abou ’ it , ”
239474	239502	239471	239471	he	205	“ What ’s comin ’ will come , an ’ we ’ll meet it when it does . Dumbledore told me wha ’ you did , Harry . ”
239513	239538	239511	239511	Harry	248	“ Yeh did as much as yer father would ’ve done , an ’ I can ’ give yeh no higher praise than that . ”
239556	239567	239568	239568	he	205	“ What ’s Dumbledore asked you to do , Hagrid ? ”
239571	239589	239568	239568	he	205	“ He sent Professor McGonagall to ask you and Madame Maxime to meet him — that night . ”
239590	239601	239603	239603	Hagrid	205	“ Got a little job fer me over the summer , ”
239605	239653	239603	239603	Hagrid	205	“ Secret , though . I ’m not s’pposed ter talk abou ’ it , no , not even ter you lot . Olympe — Madame Maxime ter you — might be comin ’ with me . I think she will . Think I got her persuaded . ”
239654	239662	239568	239568	he	205	“ Is it to do with Voldemort ? ”
239672	239677	239678	239678	he	205	“ Migh ’ be , ”
239682	239708	239709	239709	he	205	“ Now … who ’d like ter come an ’ visit the las ’ skrewt with me ? I was jokin ’ — jokin ’ ! ”
240116	240122	240109	240109	Snape	597	“ at great personal risk . ”
240210	240214	240216	240216	Dumbledore	195	“ The end , ”
240224	240229	240216	240216	Dumbledore	195	“ of another year . ”
240270	240285	240287	240287	Dumbledore	195	“ There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight , ”
240289	240309	240310	240310	he	195	“ but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person , who should be sitting here , ”
240316	240343	240310	240310	he	195	“ enjoying our feast with us . I would like you all , please , to stand , and raise your glasses , to Cedric Diggory . ”

240416	240432	240433	240433	Dumbledore	195	“ Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish Hufflepuff house , ”
240436	240487	240433	240433	Dumbledore	195	“ He was a good and loyal friend , a hard worker , he valued fair play . His death has affected you all , whether you knew him well or not . I think that you have the right , therefore , to know exactly how it came about . ”
240497	240506	240488	240488	Harry	248	“ Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort . ”
240539	240545	240546	240546	Dumbledore	195	“ The Ministry of Magic , ”
240549	240652	240546	240546	Dumbledore	195	“ does not wish me to tell you this . It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so — either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned , or because they think I should not tell you so , young as you are . It is my belief , however , that the truth is generally preferable to lies , and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident , or some sort of blunder of his own , is an insult to his memory . ”
240712	240728	240729	240729	Dumbledore	195	“ There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedric ’s death , ”
240733	240745	240729	240729	Dumbledore	195	“ I am talking , of course , about Harry Potter . ”
240770	240779	240781	240781	Dumbledore	195	“ Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort , ”
240783	240827	240781	240781	Dumbledore	195	“ He risked his own life to return Cedric ’s body to Hogwarts . He showed , in every respect , the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort , and for this , I honor him . ”
240928	240965	240925	240925	Dumbledore	195	“ The Triwizard Tournament ’s aim was to further and promote magical understanding . In the light of what has happened — of Lord Voldemort ’s return — such ties are more important than ever before . ”

241035	241134	241027	241027	his	195	“ will be welcomed back here at any time , should they wish to come . I say to you all , once again — in the light of Lord Voldemort ’s return , we are only as strong as we are united , as weak as we are divided . Lord Voldemort ’s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great . We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust . Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open .
241135	241199	241027	241027	his	195	“ It is my belief — and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken — that we are all facing dark and difficult times . Some of you in this Hall have already suffered directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort . Many of your families have been torn asunder . A week ago , a student was taken from our midst .
241200	241257	241027	241027	his	195	“ Remember Cedric . Remember , if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy , remember what happened to a boy who was good , and kind , and brave , because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort . Remember Cedric Diggory . ”

241431	241448	241420	241420	Fleur	439	“ I am ’ oping to get a job ’ ere , to improve my Eenglish . ”
241449	241456	241458	241458	Ron	196	“ It ’s very good already , ”
241474	241482	241484	241484	Fleur	439	“ Good - bye , ’ Arry , ”
241490	241500	241484	241484	Fleur	439	“ It ’ az been a pleasure meeting you ! ”
241531	241541	241543	241543	Ron	196	“ Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back , ”
241545	241556	241543	241543	Ron	196	“ D’you reckon they can steer that ship without Karkaroff ? ”
241557	241563	241583	241583	Krum	234	“ Karkaroff did not steer , ”
241569	241582	241583	241583	Krum	234	“ He stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork . ”
241594	241601	241602	241602	he	234	“ Could I have a vord ? ”
241606	241614	241616	241616	Hermione	186	“ Oh … yes … all right , ”
241633	241640	241641	241641	Ron	196	“ You ’d better hurry up ! ”
241647	241656	241641	241641	Ron	196	“ The carriages’ll be here in a minute ! ”
241711	241716	241718	241718	Krum	234	“ I liked Diggory , ”
241723	241743	241744	241744	he	196	“ He vos alvays polite to me . Alvays . Even though I vos from Durmstrang — with Karkaroff , ”
241749	241758	241760	241760	Harry	162	“ Have you got a new headmaster yet ? ”
241810	241817	241806	241806	Ron	196	“ Can I have your autograph ? ”
242088	242157	242077	242077	Hermione	186	“ There ’s nothing in there . You can look for yourself , but there ’s nothing at all . I ’ve been checking every day . Just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament . They did n’t even mention Cedric . Nothing about any of it . If you ask me , Fudge is forcing them to keep quiet . ”
242158	242166	242168	242168	Harry	162	“ He ’ll never keep Rita quiet , ”
242170	242178	242168	242168	Harry	162	“ Not on a story like this . ”
242179	242194	242196	242196	Hermione	186	“ Oh , Rita has n’t written anything at all since the third task , ”
242203	242210	242211	242211	she	186	“ As a matter of fact , ”
242220	242248	242211	242211	she	186	“ Rita Skeeter is n’t going to be writing anything at all for a while . Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her . ”
242249	242256	242258	242258	Ron	196	“ What are you talking about ? ”
242260	242284	242286	242286	Hermione	186	“ I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she was n’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds , ”
242322	242329	242331	242331	Harry	162	“ How was she doing it ? ”
242335	242342	242344	242344	Ron	196	“ How did you find out ? ”
242350	242367	242368	242368	she	186	“ Well , it was you , really , who gave me the idea , Harry , ”
242371	242375	242377	242377	Harry	162	“ Did I ? ”
242381	242384	242377	242377	Harry	162	“ How ? ”
242385	242388	242390	242390	Hermione	186	“ Bugging , ”
242393	242402	242377	242377	Harry	162	“ But you said they did n’t work — ”
242403	242409	242411	242411	Hermione	186	“ Oh not electronic bugs , ”
242413	242421	242411	242411	Hermione	186	“ No , you see … Rita Skeeter ”
242431	242441	242411	242411	Hermione	186	“ is an unregistered Animagus . She can turn — ”
242454	242460	242442	242442	Hermione	186	“ — into a beetle . ”
242461	242466	242468	242468	Ron	196	“ You ’re kidding , ”
242470	242479	242468	242468	Ron	196	“ You have n’t … she ’s not … ”
242480	242486	242488	242488	Hermione	186	“ Oh yes she is , ”
242511	242520	242521	242521	Ron	196	“ That ’s never — you ’re kidding — ”
242531	242538	242540	242540	Hermione	186	“ No , I ’m not , ”
242544	242578	242540	242540	Hermione	186	“ I caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing . Look very closely , and you ’ll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears . ”
242594	242614	242540	242540	Hermione	186	“ There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid telling Madame Maxime about his mum ! ”
242615	242618	242620	242620	Hermione	186	“ Exactly , ”
242622	242676	242620	242620	Hermione	186	“ And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we ’d had our conversation by the lake . And unless I ’m very much mistaken , Rita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar hurt . She ’s been buzzing around for stories all year . ”
242677	242686	242688	242688	Ron	196	“ When we saw Malfoy under that tree … ”
242691	242702	242704	242704	Hermione	186	“ He was talking to her , in his hand , ”
242706	242754	242704	242704	Hermione	186	“ He knew , of course . That ’s how she ’s been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins . They would n’t care that she was doing something illegal , as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and Hagrid . ”
242776	242793	242795	242795	Hermione	186	“ I ’ve told her I ’ll let her out when we get back to London , ”
242797	242850	242795	242795	Hermione	186	“ I ’ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar , you see , so she ca n’t transform . And I ’ve told her she ’s to keep her quill to herself for a whole year . See if she ca n’t break the habit of writing horrible lies about people . ”
242871	242877	242879	242880	Draco Malfoy	290	“ Very clever , Granger , ”
242913	242916	242918	242918	Malfoy	290	“ So , ”
242940	242959	242937	242937	his	290	“ You caught some pathetic reporter , and Potter ’s Dumbledore ’s favorite boy again . Big deal . ”
242969	242980	242982	242982	Malfoy	290	“ Trying not to think about it , are we ? ”
242993	243002	242982	242982	Malfoy	290	“ Trying to pretend it has n’t happened ? ”
243003	243007	243009	243009	Harry	162	“ Get out , ”
243056	243108	243109	243109	He	162	“ You ’ve picked the losing side , Potter ! I warned you ! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully , remember ? When we met on the train , first day at Hogwarts ? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this ! ”
243118	243156	243111	243111	his	162	“ Too late now , Potter ! They ’ll be the first to go , now the Dark Lord ’s back ! Mudbloods and Muggle - lovers first ! Well — second — Diggory was the f — ”
243248	243260	243262	243262	Fred	200	“ Thought we ’d see what those three were up to , ”
243301	243305	243307	243307	George	201	“ Interesting effect , ”
243314	243321	243307	243307	George	201	“ Who used the Furnunculus Curse ? ”
243322	243325	243327	243327	Harry	162	“ Me , ”
243329	243332	243334	243334	George	201	“ Odd , ”
243337	243384	243334	243334	George	201	“ I used Jelly - Legs . Looks as though those two should n’t be mixed . He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face . Well , let ’s not leave them here , they do n’t add much to the decor . ”
243442	243448	243450	243450	Fred	200	“ Exploding Snap , anyone ? ”
243473	243482	243483	243483	he	162	“ You going to tell us , then ? ”
243488	243494	243483	243483	he	162	“ Who you were blackmailing ? ”
243495	243498	243500	243500	George	201	“ Oh , ”
243503	243506	243500	243500	George	201	“ That . ”
243507	243513	243515	243515	Fred	200	“ It does n’t matter , ”
243522	243534	243515	243515	Fred	200	“ It was n’t anything important . Not now , anyway . ”
243535	243541	243543	243543	George	201	“ We ’ve given up , ”
243564	243583	243561	243561	Fred	200	“ All right , all right , if you really want to know … it was Ludo Bagman . ”
243584	243587	243589	243589	Harry	162	“ Bagman ? ”
243592	243601	243589	243589	Harry	162	“ Are you saying he was involved in — ”
243602	243605	243607	243607	George	201	“ Nah , ”
243610	243625	243607	243607	George	201	“ Nothing like that . Stupid git . He would n’t have the brains . ”
243626	243633	243635	243635	Ron	196	“ Well , what , then ? ”
243643	243671	243637	243637	Fred	200	“ You remember that bet we had with him at the Quidditch World Cup ? About how Ireland would win , but Krum would get the Snitch ? ”
243672	243675	243677	243677	Harry	162	“ Yeah , ”
243682	243700	243637	243637	Fred	200	“ Well , the git paid us in leprechaun gold he ’d caught from the Irish mascots . ”
243701	243704	243637	243637	Fred	200	“ So ? ”
243705	243708	243710	243710	Fred	200	“ So , ”
243713	243729	243710	243710	Fred	200	“ it vanished , did n’t it ? By next morning , it had gone ! ”
243730	243744	243746	243746	Hermione	186	“ But — it must ’ve been an accident , must n’t it ? ”
243753	243821	243748	243748	George	201	“ Yeah , that ’s what we thought , at first . We thought if we just wrote to him , and told him he ’d made a mistake , he ’d cough up . But nothing doing . Ignored our letter . We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts , but he was always making some excuse to get away from us . ”
243822	243832	243834	243834	Fred	200	“ In the end , he turned pretty nasty , ”
243836	243854	243834	243834	Fred	200	“ Told us we were too young to gamble , and he was n’t giving us anything . ”
243855	243864	243866	243866	George	201	“ So we asked for our money back , ”
243869	243875	243877	243877	Hermione	186	“ He did n’t refuse ! ”
243879	243884	243886	243886	Fred	200	“ Right in one , ”
243888	243896	243898	243898	Ron	196	“ But that was all your savings ! ”
243900	243906	243908	243908	George	201	“ Tell me about it , ”
243910	244036	243908	243908	George	201	“ ’ Course , we found out what was going on in the end . Lee Jordan ’s dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well . Turns out he ’s in big trouble with the goblins . Borrowed loads of gold off them . A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had , and it still was n’t enough to cover all his debts . They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him . He ’s lost everything gambling . Has n’t got two Galleons to rub together . And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back ? ”
244037	244040	244042	244042	Harry	162	“ How ? ”
244044	244054	244056	244056	Fred	200	“ He put a bet on you , mate , ”
244058	244075	244056	244056	Fred	200	“ Put a big bet on you to win the tournament . Bet against the goblins . ”
244076	244089	244091	244091	Harry	162	“ So that ’s why he kept trying to help me win ! ”
244093	244112	244091	244091	Harry	162	“ Well — I did win , did n’t I ? So he can pay you your gold ! ”
244113	244116	244118	244118	George	201	“ Nope , ”
244124	244168	244118	244118	George	201	“ The goblins play as dirty as him . They say you drew with Diggory , and Bagman was betting you ’d win outright . So Bagman had to run for it . He did run for it right after the third task . ”
244293	244302	244303	244304	The twins	1012	“ Fred — George — wait a moment . ”
244319	244323	244324	244324	he	162	“ Take it , ”
244337	244340	244342	244342	Fred	200	“ What ? ”
244347	244351	244352	244352	Harry	162	“ Take it , ”
244356	244363	244352	244352	Harry	162	“ I do n’t want it . ”
244364	244369	244371	244371	George	201	“ You ’re mental , ”
244381	244388	244390	244390	Harry	162	“ No , I ’m not , ”
244392	244408	244390	244390	Harry	162	“ You take it , and get inventing . It ’s for the joke shop . ”
244409	244414	244415	244415	Fred	200	“ He is mental , ”
244423	244426	244428	244428	Harry	162	“ Listen , ”
244431	244494	244428	244428	Harry	162	“ If you do n’t take it , I ’m throwing it down the drain . I do n’t want it and I do n’t need it . But I could do with a few laughs . We could all do with a few laughs . I ’ve got a feeling we ’re going to need them more than usual before long . ”
244495	244498	244500	244500	George	201	“ Harry , ”
244511	244523	244500	244500	George	201	“ there ’s got to be a thousand Galleons in here . ”
244524	244527	244529	244529	Harry	162	“ Yeah , ”
244533	244542	244529	244529	Harry	162	“ Think how many Canary Creams that is . ”
244549	244583	244500	244500	George	201	“ Just do n’t tell your mum where you got it … although she might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore , come to think of it . … ”
244584	244587	244588	244588	Fred	200	“ Harry , ”
244598	244601	244602	244602	he	162	“ Look , ”
244606	244644	244602	244602	he	162	“ take it , or I ’ll hex you . I know some good ones now . Just do me one favor , okay ? Buy Ron some different dress robes and say they ’re from you . ”
244708	244729	244699	244699	she	199	“ I think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer . Keep in touch , Harry . ”
244730	244736	244738	244738	Ron	196	“ See you , Harry , ”
244746	244752	244757	244757	she	186	“ ’ Bye , Harry ! ”
244773	244778	244779	244779	George	201	“ Harry — thanks , ”
