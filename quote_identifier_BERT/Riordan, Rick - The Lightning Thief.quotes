Zeus did indeed feed Kronos a mixture of mustard and wine , which made him disgorge his other five children , who , of course , being immortal gods , had been living and growing up completely undigested in the Titan ’s stomach . The gods defeated their father , sliced him to pieces with his own scythe , and scattered his remains in Tartarus , the darkest part of the Underworld . On that happy note , it ’s time for lunch . Mrs. Dodds , would you lead us back outside ? ”

13399	13409	13260	13260	Grover	252	“ So you admit there was a Mrs. Dodds ! ”

13420	13433	13434	13434	Grover	252	“ The less you knew , the fewer monsters you ’d attract , ”
13444	13480	13434	13434	Grover	252	“ We put Mist over the humans ’ eyes . We hoped you ’d think the Kindly One was a hallucination . But it was no good . You started to realize who you are . ”
13481	13494	13260	13260	Grover	252	“ Who I — wait a minute , what do you mean ? ”

13793	13834	13790	13790	Grover	252	“ Those were the Fates . Do you know what it means — the fact they appeared in front of you ? They only do that when you ’re about to . . . when someone ’s about to die . ”
13835	13844	13713	13713	she	453	“ Whoa . You said ‘ you . ’ ”

18265	18276	18213	18213	His	252	“ Like I could throw Nancy Bobofit a hundred yards . ”
18277	18282	18283	18283	he	252	“ That ’s good , ”
18286	18305	18283	18283	he	252	“ That ’s good . I do n’t think you could risk drinking any more of that stuff . ”
18306	18312	18213	18213	His	252	“ What do you mean ? ”
18336	18347	18313	18313	He	252	“ Come on . Chiron and Mr. D are waiting . ”
18751	18757	18758	18758	Grover	252	“ That ’s Mr. D , ”
18763	18807	18758	18758	Grover	252	“ He ’s the camp director . Be polite . The girl , that ’s Annabeth Chase . She ’s just a camper , but she ’s been here longer than just about anybody . And you already know Chiron . . . . ”

19434	19502	19384	19386	Chiron - Brunner	279	“ My year at Yancy Academy , to instruct you . We have satyrs at most schools , of course , keeping a lookout . But Grover alerted me as soon as he met you . He sensed you were something special , so I decided to come upstate . I convinced the other Latin teacher to . . . ah , take a leave of absence . ”

19573	19636	19570	19570	Chiron	279	“ Honestly , I was n’t sure about you at first . We contacted your mother , let her know we were keeping an eye on you in case you were ready for Camp Half - Blood . But you still had so much to learn . Nevertheless , you made it here alive , and that ’s always the first test . ”
19637	19640	19641	19642	Mr. D	268	“ Grover , ”

19756	19791	19752	19752	he	3747	“ it is , along with gladiator fighting and Pac - Man , one of the greatest games ever invented by humans . I would expect all civilized young men to know the rules . ”

19950	19994	19940	19940	her	1065	“ She told me she was afraid to send me here , even though my father had wanted her to . She said that once I was here , I probably could n’t leave . She wanted to keep me close to her . ”
19995	19998	19999	20000	Mr. D	268	“ Typical , ”

20186	20197	20198	20198	He	268	“ Oh , a royal marriage . Trick ! Trick ! ”
20207	20211	20212	20212	Grover	252	“ Mr. D , ”

20291	20314	20288	20288	Chiron	279	“ God — capital G , God . That ’s a different matter altogether . We sha n’t deal with the metaphysical . ”

20326	20360	20288	20288	Chiron	279	“ Ah , gods , plural , as in , great beings that control the forces of nature and human endeavors : the immortal gods of Olympus . That ’s a smaller matter . ”
20361	20364	20264	20264	I	0	“ Smaller ? ”
20365	20378	20288	20288	Chiron	279	“ Yes , quite . The gods we discussed in Latin class . ”

20437	20443	20444	20444	I	0	“ But they ’re stories , ”
20447	20471	20444	20444	I	0	“ They’re — myths , to explain lightning and the seasons and stuff . They ’re what people believed before there was science . ”

20480	20486	20476	20477	Mr. D	268	“ And tell me , Perseus Jackson”—I

20743	20798	20740	20740	Chiron	279	“ If you were a god , how would you like being called a myth , an old story to explain lightning ? What if I told you , Perseus Jackson , that someday people would call you a myth , just created to explain how little boys can get over losing their mothers ? ”
20826	20841	20823	20823	I	0	“ I would n’t like it . But I do n’t believe in gods . ”

The second time — well , she really was pretty , and I could n’t stay away — the second time , he sent me here . Half - Blood Hill . Summer camp for brats like you . ‘ Be a better influence , ’ he told me . ‘ Work with youths rather than tearing them down . ’ Ha ! Absolutely unfair . ”

21707	21719	21701	21702	Mr. D	268	“ Cabin eleven , Percy Jackson . And mind your manners . ”
21730	21736	21737	21737	I	0	“ Will Grover be okay ? ”
21751	21799	21745	21745	he	279	“ Old Dionysus is n’t really mad . He just hates his job . He ’s been . . . ah , grounded , I guess you would say , and he ca n’t stand waiting another century before he ’s allowed to go back to Olympus . ”
21800	21804	21805	21805	I	0	“ Mount Olympus , ”
21808	21820	21805	21805	I	0	“ You ’re telling me there really is a palace there ? ”
21821	21887	21745	21745	he	279	“ Well now , there ’s Mount Olympus in Greece . And then there ’s the home of the gods , the convergence point of their powers , which did indeed used to be on Mount Olympus . It ’s still called Mount Olympus , out of respect to the old ways , but the palace moves , Percy , just as the gods do . ”
21888	21904	21805	21805	I	0	“ You mean the Greek gods are here ? Like . . . in America ? ”
21905	21920	21745	21745	he	279	“ Well , certainly . The gods move with the heart of the West . ”
21921	21925	21805	21805	I	0	“ The what ? ”
21926	22084	21745	21745	he	279	“ Come now , Percy . What you call ‘ Western civilization . ’ Do you think it ’s just an abstract concept ? No , it ’s a living force . A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years . The gods are part of it . You might even say they are the source of it , or at least , they are tied so tightly to it that they could n’t possibly fade , not unless all of Western civilization were obliterated . The fire started in Greece . Then , as you well know — or as I hope you know , since you passed my course — the heart of the fire moved to Rome , and so did the gods . Oh , different names , perhaps — Jupiter for Zeus , Venus for Aphrodite , and so on — but the same forces , the same gods . ”
22085	22091	21805	21805	I	0	“ And then they died . ”
22092	22299	21745	21745	he	279	“ Died ? No . Did the West die ? The gods simply moved , to Germany , to France , to Spain , for a while . Wherever the flame was brightest , the gods were there . They spent several centuries in England . All you need to do is look at the architecture . People do not forget the gods . Every place they ’ve ruled , for the last three thousand years , you can see them in paintings , in statues , on the most important buildings . And yes , Percy , of course they are now in your United States . Look at your symbol , the eagle of Zeus . Look at the statue of Prometheus in Rockefeller Center , the Greek facades of your government buildings in Washington . I defy you to find any American city where the Olympians are not prominently displayed in multiple places . Like it or not — and believe me , plenty of people were n’t very fond of Rome , either — America is now the heart of the flame . It is the great power of the West . And so Olympus is here . And we are here . ”
22329	22344	22345	22345	Chiron	279	“ Who are you , Chiron ? Who . . . who am I ? ”
22380	22385	22386	22386	he	279	“ Who are you ? ”
22389	22452	22386	22386	he	279	“ Well , that ’s the question we all want answered , is n’t it ? But for now , we should get you a bunk in cabin eleven . There will be new friends to meet . And plenty of time for lessons tomorrow . Besides , there will be s’mores at the campfire tonight , and I simply adore chocolate . ”
22684	22689	22690	22691	the centaur	1083	“ What a relief , ”
22694	22725	22690	22691	the centaur	1083	“ I ’d been cooped up in there so long , my fetlocks had fallen asleep . Now , come , Percy Jackson . Let ’s meet the other campers . ”
22829	22834	22826	22826	Another	281	“ That ’s him . ”

23026	23029	23030	23030	he	279	“ No , ”
23035	23042	23030	23030	he	279	“ Not a single living thing . ”
23063	23069	23070	23070	Chiron	279	“ Come along , Percy , ”
23081	23086	23070	23070	Chiron	279	“ Lots to see . ”
23131	23137	23138	23138	he	279	“ It pays our expenses , ”
23141	23150	23138	23138	he	279	“ And the strawberries take almost no effort . ”
23254	23267	23268	23268	I	0	“ Grover wo n’t get in too much trouble , will he ? ”
23272	23286	23268	23268	I	0	“ I mean . . . he was a good protector . Really . ”
23307	23352	23290	23290	He	279	“ Grover has big dreams , Percy . Perhaps bigger than are reasonable . To reach his goal , he must first demonstrate great courage by succeeding as a keeper , finding a new camper and bringing him safely to Half - Blood Hill . ”
23353	23359	23290	23290	He	279	“ But he did that ! ”
23360	23367	23368	23368	Chiron	279	“ I might agree with you , ”
23371	23461	23368	23368	Chiron	279	“ But it is not my place to judge . Dionysus and the Council of Cloven Elders must decide . I ’m afraid they might not see this assignment as a success . After all , Grover lost you in New York . Then there ’s the unfortunate . . . ah . . . fate of your mother . And the fact that Grover was unconscious when you dragged him over the property line . The council might question whether this shows any courage on Grover ’s part . ”
23505	23517	23518	23518	Chiron	279	“ He ’ll get a second chance , wo n’t he ? ”
23521	23582	23518	23518	Chiron	279	“ I ’m afraid that was Grover ’s second chance , Percy . The council was not anxious to give him another , either , after what happened the first time , five years ago . Olympus knows , I advised him to wait longer before trying again . He ’s still so small for his age . . . . ”
23583	23589	23518	23518	Chiron	279	“ How old is he ? ”
23590	23597	23518	23518	Chiron	279	“ Oh , twenty - eight . ”
23598	23608	23518	23518	Chiron	279	“ What ! And he ’s in sixth grade ? ”
23609	23636	23518	23518	Chiron	279	“ Satyrs mature half as fast as humans , Percy . Grover has been the equivalent of a middle school student for the past six years . ”
23637	23642	23518	23518	Chiron	279	“ That ’s horrible . ”
23643	23646	23647	23647	Chiron	279	“ Quite , ”
23650	23697	23647	23647	Chiron	279	“ At any rate , Grover is a late bloomer , even by satyr standards , and not yet very accomplished at woodland magic . Alas , he was anxious to pursue his dream . Perhaps now he will find some other career . . . . ”
23698	23704	23705	23705	I	0	“ That ’s not fair , ”
23708	23721	23705	23705	I	0	“ What happened the first time ? Was it really so bad ? ”
23727	23736	23722	23722	Chiron	279	“ Let ’s move along , shall we ? ”
23791	23794	23795	23795	I	0	“ Chiron , ”
23798	23812	23795	23795	I	0	“ If the gods and Olympus and all that are real . . . ”
23813	23818	23831	23831	Chiron	279	“ Yes , child ? ”
23819	23830	23795	23795	I	0	“ Does that mean the Underworld is real , too ? ”
23836	23841	23842	23842	He	279	“ Yes , child . ”
23852	23888	23842	23842	He	279	“ There is a place where spirits go after death . But for now . . . until we know more . . . I would urge you to put that out of your mind . ”
23889	23902	23959	23959	Chiron	279	“ What do you mean , ‘ until we know more ’ ? ”
23903	23914	23842	23842	He	279	“ Come , Percy . Let ’s see the woods . ”
23962	23980	23959	23959	Chiron	279	“ The woods are stocked , if you care to try your luck , but go armed . ”
23981	23986	23987	23987	I	0	“ Stocked with what ? ”
23990	23995	23987	23987	I	0	“ Armed with what ? ”
23996	24017	23959	23959	Chiron	279	“ You ’ll see . Capture the flag is Friday night . Do you have your own sword and shield ? ”
24018	24023	23987	23987	I	0	“ My own — ? ”
24024	24027	24028	24028	Chiron	279	“ No , ”
24031	24054	24028	24028	Chiron	279	“ I do n’t suppose you do . I think a size five will do . I ’ll visit the armory later . ”
24130	24136	24137	24137	I	0	“ Sword and spear fights ? ”
24140	24147	24148	24148	he	279	“ Cabin challenges and all that , ”
24151	24168	24148	24148	he	279	“ Not lethal . Usually . Oh , yes , and there ’s the mess hall . ”
24201	24210	24211	24211	I	0	“ What do you do when it rains ? ”
24227	24238	24214	24214	Chiron	279	“ We still have to eat , do n’t we ? ”
24564	24569	24570	24570	I	0	“ Zeus and Hera ? ”
24573	24576	24577	24577	Chiron	279	“ Correct , ”
24580	24586	24577	24577	Chiron	279	“ Their cabins look empty . ”
24587	24607	24577	24577	Chiron	279	“ Several of the cabins are . That ’s true . No one ever stays in one or two . ”
24710	24719	24707	24707	Chiron	279	“ Oh , I would n’t do that ! ”
24797	24803	24789	24789	his	279	“ Come along , Percy . ”
24977	24986	24987	24987	I	0	“ We have n’t seen any other centaurs , ”
24990	24993	24995	24995	Chiron	279	“ No , ”
24998	25034	24995	24995	Chiron	279	“ My kinsmen are a wild and barbaric folk , I ’m afraid . You might encounter them in the wilderness , or at major sporting events . But you wo n’t see any here . ”
25035	25049	25088	25088	Chiron	279	“ You said your name was Chiron . Are you really . . . ”
25056	25077	25050	25050	He	279	“ The Chiron from the stories ? Trainer of Hercules and all that ? Yes , Percy , I am . ”
25078	25087	24995	24995	Chiron	279	“ But , should n’t you be dead ? ”
25098	25182	25088	25088	Chiron	279	“ I honestly do n’t know about should be . The truth is , I ca n’t be dead . You see , eons ago the gods granted my wish . I could continue the work I loved . I could be a teacher of heroes as long as humanity needed me . I gained much from that wish . . . and I gave up much . But I ’m still here , so I can only assume I ’m still needed . ”
25208	25216	25243	25243	Chiron	279	“ Does n’t it ever get boring ? ”
25217	25222	25223	25223	he	279	“ No , no , ”
25226	25237	25223	25223	he	279	“ Horribly depressing , at times , but never boring . ”
25238	25242	25243	25243	Chiron	279	“ Why depressing ? ”
25252	25257	25258	25258	he	279	“ Oh , look , ”
25261	25268	25258	25258	he	279	“ Annabeth is waiting for us . ”
25390	25393	25394	25394	Chiron	279	“ Annabeth , ”
25397	25414	25394	25394	Chiron	279	“ I have masters ’ archery class at noon . Would you take Percy from here ? ”
25415	25420	25426	25426	Chiron	279	“ Yes , sir . ”
25421	25425	25426	25426	Chiron	279	“ Cabin eleven , ”
25435	25441	25426	25426	Chiron	279	“ Make yourself at home . ”
25585	25590	25591	25591	Chiron	279	“ Well , then , ”
25594	25607	25591	25591	Chiron	279	“ Good luck , Percy . I ’ll see you at dinner . ”
25657	25660	25661	25661	Annabeth	266	“ Well ? ”
25664	25668	25661	25661	Annabeth	266	“ Go on . ”
25703	25711	25700	25700	Annabeth	266	“ Percy Jackson , meet cabin eleven . ”
25712	25717	25718	25718	somebody	546	“ Regular or undetermined ? ”
25733	25736	25730	25730	Annabeth	266	“ Undetermined . ”
25753	25785	25740	25749	A guy who was a little older than the rest	1184	“ Now , now , campers . That ’s what we ’re here for . Welcome , Percy . You can have that spot on the floor , right over there . ”
25868	25873	25878	25878	her	266	“ This is Luke , ”
25906	25914	25901	25901	her	266	“ He ’s your counselor for now . ”
25915	25919	25920	25920	I	0	“ For now ? ”
25923	25928	25929	25929	Luke	288	“ You ’re undetermined , ”
25933	25975	25929	25929	Luke	288	“ They do n’t know what cabin to put you in , so you ’re here . Cabin eleven takes all newcomers , all visitors . Naturally , we would . Hermes , our patron , is the god of travelers . ”
26072	26080	26081	26081	I	0	“ How long will I be here ? ”
26084	26088	26089	26089	Luke	288	“ Good question , ”
26092	26098	26089	26089	Luke	288	“ Until you ’re determined . ”
26099	26106	26117	26117	Annabeth	266	“ How long will that take ? ”
26112	26116	26117	26117	Annabeth	266	“ Come on , ”
26121	26130	26117	26117	Annabeth	266	“ I ’ll show you the volleyball court . ”
26131	26138	26117	26117	Annabeth	266	“ I ’ve already seen it . ”
26139	26143	26144	26144	She	266	“ Come on . ”
26176	26187	26173	26173	Annabeth	266	“ Jackson , you have to do better than that . ”
26188	26191	26173	26173	Annabeth	266	“ What ? ”
26202	26214	26192	26192	She	266	“ I ca n’t believe I thought you were the one . ”
26215	26221	26199	26199	her	266	“ What ’s your problem ? ”
26228	26240	26199	26199	her	266	“ All I know is , I kill some bull guy — ”
26241	26248	26249	26249	Annabeth	266	“ Do n’t talk like that ! ”
26253	26269	26249	26249	Annabeth	266	“ You know how many kids at this camp wish they ’d had your chance ? ”
26270	26275	26249	26249	Annabeth	266	“ To get killed ? ”
26276	26290	26249	26249	Annabeth	266	“ To fight the Minotaur ! What do you think we train for ? ”
26296	26318	26291	26291	I	0	“ Look , if the thing I fought really was the Minotaur , the same one in the stories . . . ”
26319	26322	26249	26249	Annabeth	266	“ Yes . ”
26323	26330	26291	26291	I	0	“ Then there ’s only one . ”
26331	26334	26249	26249	Annabeth	266	“ Yes . ”
26335	26360	26291	26291	I	0	“ And he died , like , a gajillion years ago , right ? Theseus killed him in the labyrinth . So . . . ”
26361	26380	26249	26249	Annabeth	266	“ Monsters do n’t die , Percy . They can be killed . But they do n’t die . ”
26381	26391	26291	26291	I	0	“ Oh , thanks . That clears it up . ”
26392	26441	26249	26249	Annabeth	266	“ They do n’t have souls , like you and me . You can dispel them for a while , maybe even for a whole lifetime if you ’re lucky . But they are primal forces . Chiron calls them archetypes . Eventually , they re - form . ”
26448	26462	26445	26446	Mrs. Dodds	229	“ You mean if I killed one , accidentally , with a sword — ”
26463	26495	26291	26291	I	0	“ The Fur . . . I mean , your math teacher . That ’s right . She ’s still out there . You just made her very , very mad . ”
26496	26505	26445	26446	Mrs. Dodds	229	“ How did you know about Mrs. Dodds ? ”
26506	26513	26291	26291	I	0	“ You talk in your sleep . ”
26514	26532	26445	26446	Mrs. Dodds	229	“ You almost called her something . A Fury ? They ’re Hades ’ torturers , right ? ”
26552	26581	26542	26542	she	266	“ You should n’t call them by name , even here . We call them the Kindly Ones , if we have to speak of them at all . ”
26582	26595	26596	26596	I	0	“ Look , is there anything we can say without it thundering ? ”
26612	26642	26607	26607	I	0	“ Why do I have to stay in cabin eleven , anyway ? Why is everybody so crowded together ? There are plenty of empty bunks right over there . ”
26656	26682	26652	26652	Annabeth	266	“ You do n’t just choose a cabin , Percy . It depends on who your parents are . Or . . . your parent . ”
26695	26702	26703	26703	I	0	“ My mom is Sally Jackson , ”
26706	26725	26703	26703	I	0	“ She works at the candy store in Grand Central Station . At least , she used to . ”
26726	26755	26683	26683	She	266	“ I ’m sorry about your mom , Percy . But that ’s not what I mean . I ’m talking about your other parent . Your dad . ”
26756	26766	26703	26703	I	0	“ He ’s dead . I never knew him . ”
26782	26791	26772	26772	she	266	“ Your father ’s not dead , Percy . ”
26792	26803	26683	26683	She	266	“ How can you say that ? You know him ? ”
26804	26811	26772	26772	she	266	“ No , of course not . ”
26812	26819	26683	26683	She	266	“ Then how can you say — ”
26820	26839	26772	26772	she	266	“ Because I know you . You would n’t be here if you were n’t one of us . ”
26840	26849	26683	26683	She	266	“ You do n’t know anything about me . ”
26850	26853	26854	26854	She	266	“ No ? ”
26859	26882	26854	26854	She	266	“ I bet you moved around from school to school . I bet you were kicked out of a lot of them . ”
26883	26886	26683	26683	She	266	“ How — ”
26887	26897	26854	26854	She	266	“ Diagnosed with dyslexia . Probably ADHD , too . ”
26905	26915	26898	26898	I	0	“ What does that have to do with anything ? ”
26916	27038	26683	26683	She	266	“ Taken together , it ’s almost a sure sign . The letters float off the page when you read , right ? That ’s because your mind is hardwired for ancient Greek . And the ADHD — you’re impulsive , ca n’t sit still in the classroom . That ’s your battlefield reflexes . In a real fight , they ’d keep you alive . As for the attention problems , that ’s because you see too much , Percy , not too little . Your senses are better than a regular mortal ’s . Of course the teachers want you medicated . Most of them are monsters . They do n’t want you seeing them for what they are . ”
27039	27053	26898	26898	I	0	“ You sound like . . . you went through the same thing ? ”
27054	27084	26683	26683	She	266	“ Most of the kids here did . If you were n’t like us , you could n’t have survived the Minotaur , much less the ambrosia and nectar . ”
27085	27090	26898	26898	I	0	“ Ambrosia and nectar . ”
27091	27143	26683	26683	She	266	“ The food and drink we were giving you to make you better . That stuff would ’ve killed a normal kid . It would ’ve turned your blood to fire and your bones to sand and you ’d be dead . Face it . You ’re a half - blood . ”
27170	27176	26683	26683	She	266	“ Well ! A newbie ! ”
27217	27220	27221	27221	Annabeth	266	“ Clarisse , ”
27224	27236	27221	27221	Annabeth	266	“ Why do n’t you go polish your spear or something ? ”
27237	27243	27244	27246	the big girl	1200	“ Sure , Miss Princess , ”
27249	27261	27244	27246	the big girl	1200	“ So I can run you through with it Friday night . ”
27262	27267	27268	27268	Annabeth	266	“ Erre es korakas ! ”
27299	27307	27268	27268	Annabeth	266	“ You do n’t stand a chance . ”
27308	27314	27315	27315	Clarisse	292	“ We ’ll pulverize you , ”
27341	27348	27336	27336	She	292	“ Who ’s this little runt ? ”
27349	27353	27354	27354	Annabeth	266	“ Percy Jackson , ”
27357	27365	27354	27354	Annabeth	266	“ meet Clarisse , Daughter of Ares . ”
27369	27378	27354	27354	Annabeth	266	“ Like . . . the war god ? ”
27382	27390	27379	27379	Clarisse	292	“ You got a problem with that ? ”
27391	27394	27395	27395	I	0	“ No , ”
27402	27409	27379	27379	Clarisse	292	“ It explains the bad smell . ”
27413	27424	27410	27410	Clarisse	292	“ We got an initiation ceremony for newbies , Prissy . ”
27425	27428	27379	27379	Clarisse	292	“ Percy . ”
27429	27440	27410	27410	Clarisse	292	“ Whatever . Come on , I ’ll show you . ”
27441	27444	27445	27445	Annabeth	266	“ Clarisse — ”
27450	27459	27445	27445	Annabeth	266	“ Stay out of it , wise girl . ”
27665	27675	27679	27679	she	292	“ Like he ’s ‘ Big Three ’ material , ”
27688	27705	27679	27679	she	292	“ Yeah , right . Minotaur probably fell over laughing , he was so stupid looking . ”
28090	28097	28087	28087	Annabeth	266	“ How did you . . . ”
28098	28104	28105	28105	We	1221	“ I do n’t know . ”
28164	28177	28155	28155	She	266	“ You are dead , new boy . You are totally dead . ”
28190	28206	28187	28187	I	0	“ You want to gargle with toilet water again , Clarisse ? Close your mouth . ”
28257	28260	28261	28261	I	0	“ What ? ”
28264	28270	28261	28261	I	0	“ What are you thinking ? ”
28271	28276	28277	28277	she	266	“ I ’m thinking , ”

28437	28445	28446	28446	Annabeth	266	“ I ’ve got training to do , ”
28450	28467	28446	28446	Annabeth	266	“ Dinner ’s at seven - thirty . Just follow your cabin to the mess hall . ”

28538	28547	28548	28548	Annabeth	266	“ You need to talk to the Oracle , ”
28551	28554	28548	28548	Annabeth	266	“ Who ? ”
28555	28569	28548	28548	Annabeth	266	“ Not who . What . The Oracle . I ’ll ask Chiron . ”
28684	28690	28691	28691	Annabeth	266	“ Do n’t encourage them , ”
28694	28700	28691	28691	Annabeth	266	“ Naiads are terrible flirts . ”
28701	28704	28705	28705	I	0	“ Naiads , ”
28712	28724	28705	28705	I	0	“ That ’s it . I want to go home now . ”
28728	28754	28725	28725	Annabeth	266	“ Do n’t you get it , Percy ? You are home . This is the only safe place on earth for kids like us . ”
28755	28763	28725	28725	Annabeth	266	“ You mean , mentally disturbed kids ? ”
28764	28780	28725	28725	Annabeth	266	“ I mean not human . Not totally human , anyway . Half - human . ”
28781	28790	28725	28725	Annabeth	266	“ Half - human and half - what ? ”
28791	28797	28725	28725	Annabeth	266	“ I think you know . ”
28834	28837	28838	28838	I	0	“ God , ”
28841	28846	28838	28838	I	0	“ Half - god . ”
28850	28866	28847	28847	Annabeth	266	“ Your father is n’t dead , Percy . He ’s one of the Olympians . ”
28867	28875	28847	28847	Annabeth	266	“ That ’s . . . crazy . ”
28876	28921	28847	28847	Annabeth	266	“ Is it ? What ’s the most common thing gods did in the old stories ? They ran around falling in love with humans and having kids with them . Do you think they ’ve changed their habits in the last few millennia ? ”
28922	28928	28929	28929	I	0	“ But those are just — ”
28954	28966	28938	28938	Chiron	279	“ But if all the kids here are half - gods — ”
28967	28970	28971	28971	Annabeth	266	“ Demigods , ”
28974	28986	28971	28971	Annabeth	266	“ That ’s the official term . Or half - bloods . ”
28987	28994	28938	28938	Chiron	279	“ Then who ’s your dad ? ”
29016	29026	29027	29027	she	266	“ My dad is a professor at West Point , ”
29030	29047	29027	29027	she	266	“ I have n’t seen him since I was very small . He teaches American history . ”
29048	29053	28995	28995	Her	266	“ He ’s human . ”
29054	29078	29027	29027	she	266	“ What ? You assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive ? How sexist is that ? ”
29079	29087	28995	28995	Her	266	“ Who ’s your mom , then ? ”
29088	29092	29027	29027	she	266	“ Cabin six . ”
29093	29096	28995	28995	Her	266	“ Meaning ? ”
29100	29109	29097	29097	Annabeth	266	“ Athena . Goddess of wisdom and battle . ”
29118	29123	29027	29027	she	266	“ And my dad ? ”
29124	29127	29128	29128	Annabeth	266	“ Undetermined , ”
29131	29141	29128	29128	Annabeth	266	“ like I told you before . Nobody knows . ”
29142	29150	29027	29027	she	266	“ Except my mother . She knew . ”
29151	29165	29128	29128	Annabeth	266	“ Maybe not , Percy . Gods do n’t always reveal their identities . ”
29166	29176	29027	29027	she	266	“ My dad would have . He loved her . ”
29193	29234	29184	29184	She	266	“ Maybe you ’re right . Maybe he ’ll send a sign . That ’s the only way to know for sure : your father has to send you a sign claiming you as his son . Sometimes it happens . ”
29235	29243	29177	29177	Annabeth	266	“ You mean sometimes it does n’t ? ”
29252	29288	29246	29246	her	266	“ The gods are busy . They have a lot of kids and they do n’t always . . . Well , sometimes they do n’t care about us , Percy . They ignore us . ”
29359	29366	29367	29367	I	0	“ So I ’m stuck here , ”
29370	29382	29367	29367	I	0	“ That ’s it ? For the rest of my life ? ”
29383	29387	29388	29388	Annabeth	266	“ It depends , ”
29391	29575	29388	29388	Annabeth	266	“ Some campers only stay the summer . If you ’re a child of Aphrodite or Demeter , you ’re probably not a real powerful force . The monsters might ignore you , so you can get by with a few months of summer training and live in the mortal world the rest of the year . But for some of us , it ’s too dangerous to leave . We ’re year - rounders . In the mortal world , we attract monsters . They sense us . They come to challenge us . Most of the time , they ’ll ignore us until we ’re old enough to cause trouble — about ten or eleven years old , but after that , most demigods either make their way here , or they get killed off . A few manage to survive in the outside world and become famous . Believe me , if I told you the names , you ’d know them . Some do n’t even realize they ’re demigods . But very , very few are like that . ”
29576	29585	29696	29696	she	266	“ So monsters ca n’t get in here ? ”
29591	29610	29588	29588	her	266	“ Not unless they ’re intentionally stocked in the woods or specially summoned by somebody on the inside . ”
29611	29621	29696	29696	she	266	“ Why would anybody want to summon a monster ? ”
29622	29629	29588	29588	her	266	“ Practice fights . Practical jokes . ”
29630	29634	29696	29696	she	266	“ Practical jokes ? ”
29635	29670	29588	29588	her	266	“ The point is , the borders are sealed to keep mortals and monsters out . From the outside , mortals look into the valley and see nothing unusual , just a strawberry farm . ”
29671	29683	29696	29696	she	266	“ So . . . you ’re a year - rounder ? ”
29734	29744	29745	29745	she	266	“ I ’ve been here since I was seven , ”
29748	29787	29745	29745	she	266	“ Every August , on the last day of summer session , you get a bead for surviving another year . I ’ve been here longer than most of the counselors , and they ’re all in college . ”
29788	29796	29696	29696	she	266	“ Why did you come so young ? ”
29805	29811	29797	29797	She	266	“ None of your business . ”
29812	29815	29816	29816	I	0	“ Oh . ”
29826	29845	29816	29816	I	0	“ So . . . I could just walk out of here right now if I wanted to ? ”
29846	29882	29797	29797	She	266	“ It would be suicide , but you could , with Mr. D ’s or Chiron ’s permission . But they would n’t give permission until the end of the summer session unless . . . ”
29883	29886	29816	29816	I	0	“ Unless ? ”
29887	29906	29797	29797	She	266	“ You were granted a quest . But that hardly ever happens . The last time . . . ”
29927	29934	29935	29935	I	0	“ Back in the sick room , ”
29938	29947	29935	29935	I	0	“ when you were feeding me that stuff — ”
29948	29951	29816	29816	I	0	“ Ambrosia . ”
29952	29964	29935	29935	I	0	“ Yeah . You asked me something about the summer solstice . ”
29970	29977	29965	29965	Annabeth	266	“ So you do know something ? ”
29978	30027	29816	29816	I	0	“ Well . . . no . Back at my old school , I overheard Grover and Chiron talking about it . Grover mentioned the summer solstice . He said something like we did n’t have much time , because of the deadline . What did that mean ? ”
30033	30075	30028	30028	She	266	“ I wish I knew . Chiron and the satyrs , they know , but they wo n’t tell me . Something is wrong in Olympus , something pretty major . Last time I was there , everything seemed so normal . ”
30076	30083	29965	29965	Annabeth	266	“ You ’ve been to Olympus ? ”
30084	30122	30028	30028	She	266	“ Some of us year - rounders — Luke and Clarisse and I and a few others — we took a field trip during winter solstice . That ’s when the gods have their big annual council . ”
30123	30134	29965	29965	Annabeth	266	“ But . . . how did you get there ? ”
30135	30163	30164	30164	She	1253	“ The Long Island Railroad , of course . You get off at Penn Station . Empire State Building , special elevator to the six hundredth floor . ”
30178	30187	30169	30169	she	1253	“ You are a New Yorker , right ? ”
30188	30193	29965	29965	Annabeth	266	“ Oh , sure . ”
30223	30229	30230	30230	Annabeth	266	“ Right after we visited , ”
30233	30349	30230	30230	Annabeth	266	“ the weather got weird , as if the gods had started fighting . A couple of times since , I ’ve overheard satyrs talking . The best I can figure out is that something important was stolen . And if it is n’t returned by summer solstice , there ’s going to be trouble . When you came , I was hoping . . . I mean — Athena can get along with just about anybody , except for Ares . And of course she ’s got the rivalry with Poseidon . But , I mean , aside from that , I thought we could work together . I thought you might know something . ”
30378	30387	30388	30388	Annabeth	266	“ I ’ve got to get a quest , ”
30393	30411	30391	30391	herself	266	“ I ’m not too young . If they would just tell me the problem . . . ”
30578	30585	30586	30586	he	288	“ Found you a sleeping bag , ”
30589	30603	30586	30586	he	288	“ And here , I stole you some toiletries from the camp store . ”
30620	30623	30617	30617	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
30624	30628	30629	30629	Luke	288	“ No prob . ”
30642	30647	30629	30629	Luke	288	“ Tough first day ? ”
30648	30655	30656	30656	I	0	“ I do n’t belong here , ”
30659	30668	30656	30656	I	0	“ I do n’t even believe in gods . ”
30669	30672	30673	30673	he	288	“ Yeah , ”
30676	30698	30673	30673	he	288	“ That ’s how we all started . Once you start believing in them ? It does n’t get any easier . ”
30726	30733	30734	30734	I	0	“ So your dad is Hermes ? ”
30773	30778	30761	30761	he	288	“ Yeah . Hermes . ”
30779	30787	30737	30737	He	288	“ The wing - footed messenger guy . ”
30788	30831	30761	30761	he	288	“ That ’s him . Messengers . Medicine . Travelers , merchants , thieves . Anybody who uses the roads . That ’s why you ’re here , enjoying cabin eleven ’s hospitality . Hermes is n’t picky about who he sponsors . ”
30853	30860	30861	30861	I	0	“ You ever meet your dad ? ”
30864	30867	30887	30887	he	288	“ Once . ”
30915	30951	30907	30907	Luke	288	“ Do n’t worry about it , Percy . The campers here , they ’re mostly good people . After all , we ’re extended family , right ? We take care of each other . ”
31044	31093	31029	31029	my	0	“ Clarisse , from Ares , was joking about me being ‘ Big Three ’ material . Then Annabeth . . . twice , she said I might be ‘ the one . ’ She said I should talk to the Oracle . What was that all about ? ”
31099	31104	31094	31094	Luke	288	“ I hate prophecies . ”
31105	31111	31112	31112	His	288	“ What do you mean ? ”
31119	31231	31112	31112	His	288	“ Let ’s just say I messed things up for everybody else . The last two years , ever since my trip to the Garden of the Hesperides went sour , Chiron has n’t allowed any more quests . Annabeth ’s been dying to get out into the world . She pestered Chiron so much he finally told her he already knew her fate . He ’d had a prophecy from the Oracle . He would n’t tell her the whole thing , but he said Annabeth was n’t destined to go on a quest yet . She had to wait until . . . somebody special came to the camp . ”
31232	31236	31313	31313	Luke	288	“ Somebody special ? ”
31237	31246	31247	31247	Luke	288	“ Do n’t worry about it , kid , ”
31250	31280	31247	31247	Luke	288	“ Annabeth wants to think every new camper who comes through here is the omen she ’s been waiting for . Now , come on , it ’s dinnertime . ”
31316	31322	31313	31313	Luke	288	“ Eleven , fall in ! ”
31698	31703	31693	31693	He	279	“ To the gods ! ”
31710	31715	31704	31705	Everybody else	520	“ To the gods ! ”
31750	31764	31747	31747	Luke	288	“ Speak to it . Whatever you want — nonalcoholic , of course . ”

31968	31980	31962	31962	Luke	288	“ Burnt offerings for the gods . They like the smell . ”
31981	31986	31987	31987	His	288	“ You ’re kidding . ”
32038	32041	32025	32025	his	288	“ Hermes . ”
32184	32225	32175	32176	Mr. D	268	“ Yes , I suppose I ’d better say hello to all you brats . Well , hello . Our activities director , Chiron , says the next capture the flag is Friday . Cabin five presently holds the laurels . ”
32237	32240	32241	32242	Mr. D	268	“ Personally , ”
32245	32272	32241	32242	Mr. D	268	“ I could n’t care less , but congratulations . Also , I should tell you that we have a new camper today . Peter Johnson . ”
32277	32283	32284	32285	Mr. D	268	“ Er , Percy Jackson , ”
32288	32310	32284	32285	Mr. D	268	“ That ’s right . Hurrah , and all that . Now run along to your silly campfire . Go on . ”
32761	32772	32773	32773	she	292	“ There ’s more where that came from , punk , ”

33410	33413	33382	33382	he	288	“ Lunge ! ”
33416	33421	33382	33382	he	288	“ Now , back ! ”
33486	33493	33494	33494	Luke	288	“ Okay , everybody circle up ! ”
33497	33513	33494	33494	Luke	288	“ If Percy does n’t mind , I want to give you a little demo . ”
33600	33605	33606	33606	he	288	“ This is difficult , ”
33609	33636	33606	33606	he	288	“ I ’ve had it used against me . No laughing at Percy , now . Most swordsmen have to work years to master this technique . ”
33658	33664	33665	33665	he	288	“ Now in real time , ”
33675	33691	33665	33665	he	288	“ We keep sparring until one of us pulls it off . Ready , Percy ? ”
33868	33873	33863	33863	I	0	“ Um , sorry . ”
33885	33888	33889	33889	His	288	“ Sorry ? ”

33974	33979	33968	33971	somebody in the audience	1372	“ Beginner ’s luck ? ”
33998	34001	34002	34002	he	288	“ Maybe , ”
34005	34021	34002	34002	he	288	“ But I wonder what Percy could do with a balanced sword . . . . ”
34123	34126	34127	34127	he	252	“ Fine , ”
34130	34134	34127	34127	he	252	“ Just great . ”
34135	34144	34114	34114	His	252	“ So your career ’s still on track ? ”
34151	34164	34145	34145	He	252	“ Chiron t - told you I want a searcher ’s license ? ”
34165	34172	34173	34173	I	0	“ Well . . . no . ”
34196	34228	34145	34145	He	252	“ He just said you had big plans , you know . . . and that you needed credit for completing a keeper ’s assignment . So did you get it ? ”
34236	34291	34229	34229	Grover	252	“ Mr. D suspended judgment . He said I had n’t failed or succeeded with you yet , so our fates were still tied together . If you got a quest and I went along to protect you , and we both came back alive , then maybe he ’d consider the job complete . ”
34296	34307	34229	34229	Grover	252	“ Well , that ’s not so bad , right ? ”
34308	34351	34292	34292	My	0	“ Blaa - ha - ha ! He might as well have transferred me to stable - cleaning duty . The chances of you getting a quest . . . and even if you did , why would you want me along ? ”
34352	34361	34229	34229	Grover	252	“ Of course I ’d want you along ! ”
34369	34385	34362	34362	Grover	252	“ Basket - weaving . . . Must be nice to have a useful skill . ”
34439	34451	34452	34452	he	252	“ Number eight , the silver one , belongs to Artemis , ”
34455	34492	34452	34452	he	252	“ She vowed to be a maiden forever . So of course , no kids . The cabin is , you know , honorary . If she did n’t have one , she ’d be mad . ”
34493	34515	34516	34516	Grover	252	“ Yeah , okay . But the other three , the ones at the end . Are those the Big Three ? ”
34528	34542	34543	34543	he	252	“ No . One of them , number two , is Hera ’s , ”
34546	34599	34543	34543	he	252	“ That ’s another honorary thing . She ’s the goddess of marriage , so of course she would n’t go around having affairs with mortals . That ’s her husband ’s job . When we say the Big Three , we mean the three powerful brothers , the sons of Kronos . ”
34600	34607	34516	34516	Grover	252	“ Zeus , Poseidon , Hades . ”
34608	34639	34543	34543	he	252	“ Right . You know . After the great battle with the Titans , they took over the world from their dad and drew lots to decide who got what . ”
34640	34646	34647	34647	I	0	“ Zeus got the sky , ”
34650	34659	34647	34647	I	0	“ Poseidon the sea , Hades the Underworld . ”
34660	34665	34543	34543	he	252	“ Uh - huh . ”
34666	34676	34647	34647	I	0	“ But Hades does n’t have a cabin here . ”
34677	34713	34714	34714	Grover	252	“ No . He does n’t have a throne on Olympus , either . He sort of does his own thing down in the Underworld . If he did have a cabin here . . . ”
34717	34733	34714	34714	Grover	252	“ Well , it would n’t be pleasant . Let ’s leave it at that . ”
34734	34759	34647	34647	I	0	“ But Zeus and Poseidon — they both had , like , a bazillion kids in the myths . Why are their cabins empty ? ”
34766	34875	34760	34760	Grover	252	“ About sixty years ago , after World War II , the Big Three agreed they would n’t sire any more heroes . Their children were just too powerful . They were affecting the course of human events too much , causing too much carnage . World War II , you know , that was basically a fight between the sons of Zeus and Poseidon on one side , and the sons of Hades on the other . The winning side , Zeus and Poseidon , made Hades swear an oath with them : no more affairs with mortal women . They all swore on the River Styx . ”
34882	34893	34879	34879	I	0	“ That ’s the most serious oath you can make . ”
34897	34908	34894	34894	Grover	252	“ And the brothers kept their word — no kids ? ”
34914	34988	34909	34909	Grover	252	“ Seventeen years ago , Zeus fell off the wagon . There was this TV starlet with a big fluffy eighties hairdo — he just could n’t help himself . When their child was born , a little girl named Thalia . . . well , the River Styx is serious about promises . Zeus himself got off easy because he ’s immortal , but he brought a terrible fate on his daughter . ”
34989	35005	35126	35126	He	1380	“ But that is n’t fair ! It was n’t the little girl ’s fault . ”
35009	35125	35006	35006	Grover	252	“ Percy , children of the Big Three have powers greater than other half - bloods . They have a strong aura , a scent that attracts monsters . When Hades found out about the girl , he was n’t too happy about Zeus breaking his oath . Hades let the worst monsters out of Tartarus to torment Thalia . A satyr was assigned to be her keeper when she was twelve , but there was nothing he could do . He tried to escort her here with a couple of other half - bloods she ’d befriended . They almost made it . They got all the way to the top of that hill . ”
35143	35286	35126	35126	He	1380	“ All three Kindly Ones were after them , along with a hoard of hellhounds . They were about to be overrun when Thalia told her satyr to take the other two half - bloods to safety while she held off the monsters . She was wounded and tired , and she did n’t want to live like a hunted animal . The satyr did n’t want to leave her , but he could n’t change her mind , and he had to protect the others . So Thalia made her final stand alone , at the top of that hill . As she died , Zeus took pity on her . He turned her into that pine tree . Her spirit still helps protect the borders of the valley . That ’s why the hill is called Half - Blood Hill . ”
35359	35362	35363	35363	I	0	“ Grover , ”
35366	35377	35363	35363	I	0	“ have heroes really gone on quests to the Underworld ? ”
35378	35381	35382	35382	he	1386	“ Sometimes , ”
35385	35392	35382	35382	he	1386	“ Orpheus . Hercules . Houdini . ”
35393	35404	35363	35363	I	0	“ And have they ever returned somebody from the dead ? ”
35405	35425	35382	35382	he	1386	“ No . Never . Orpheus came close . . . . Percy , you ’re not seriously thinking — ”
35426	35429	35430	35430	I	0	“ No , ”
35433	35453	35430	35430	I	0	“ I was just wondering . So . . . a satyr is always assigned to guard a demigod ? ”
35473	35542	35465	35465	I	0	“ Not always . We go undercover to a lot of schools . We try to sniff out the half - bloods who have the makings of great heroes . If we find one with a very strong aura , like a child of the Big Three , we alert Chiron . He tries to keep an eye on them , since they could cause really huge problems . ”
35543	35559	35560	35560	Grover	252	“ And you found me . Chiron said you thought I might be something special . ”
35573	35644	35560	35560	Grover	252	“ I did n’t . . . Oh , listen , do n’t think like that . If you were — you know — you’d never ever be allowed a quest , and I ’d never get my license . You ’re probably a child of Hermes . Or maybe even one of the minor gods , like Nemesis , the god of revenge . Do n’t worry , okay ? ”
35790	35796	35780	35780	I	0	“ Those are the flags ? ”
35797	35800	35780	35780	I	0	“ Yeah . ”

35819	35823	35816	35816	he	288	“ But often . ”
35824	35842	35780	35780	I	0	“ So , if another cabin captures one , what do you do — repaint the flag ? ”
35846	35858	35843	35843	He	288	“ You ’ll see . First we have to get one . ”
35859	35866	35867	35867	He	288	“ Whose side are we on ? ”
35897	35923	35889	35889	him	288	“ We ’ve made a temporary alliance with Athena . Tonight , we get the flag from Ares . And you are going to help . ”
36135	36138	36139	36139	he	279	“ Heroes ! ”
36142	36215	36139	36139	he	279	“ You know the rules . The creek is the boundary line . The entire forest is fair game . All magic items are allowed . The banner must be prominently displayed , and have no more than two guards . Prisoners may be disarmed , but may not be bound or gagged . No killing or maiming is allowed . I will serve as referee and battlefield medic . Arm yourselves ! ”
36243	36246	36247	36247	I	0	“ Whoa , ”
36250	36259	36247	36247	I	0	“ We ’re really supposed to use these ? ”
36270	36299	36260	36260	Luke	288	“ Unless you want to get skewered by your friends in cabin five . Here — Chiron thought these would fit . You ’ll be on border patrol . ”

36485	36516	36482	36482	she	266	“ You do n’t want that thing touching you . Otherwise , do n’t worry . We ’ll take the banner from Ares . Has Luke given you your job ? ”

36526	36553	36482	36482	she	266	“ It ’s easy . Stand by the creek , keep the reds away . Leave the rest to me . Athena always has a plan . ”

36571	36580	36568	36568	I	0	“ Glad you wanted me on your team . ”

Afterward , Zeus realized his master bolt was missing , taken from the throne room under his very nose . He immediately blamed Poseidon . Now , a god can not usurp another god ’s symbol of power directly — that is forbidden by the most ancient of divine laws . But Zeus believes your father convinced a human hero to take it . ”
41577	41583	41419	41419	Chiron	279	“ But I did n’t — ”
41584	41591	41592	41592	Chiron	279	“ Patience and listen , child , ”
41595	41716	41592	41592	Chiron	279	“ Zeus has good reason to be suspicious . The forges of the Cyclopes are under the ocean , which gives Poseidon some influence over the makers of his brother ’s lightning . Zeus believes Poseidon has taken the master bolt , and is now secretly having the Cyclopes build an arsenal of illegal copies , which might be used to topple Zeus from his throne . The only thing Zeus was n’t sure about was which hero Poseidon used to steal the bolt . Now Poseidon has openly claimed you as his son . You were in New York over the winter holidays . You could easily have snuck into Olympus . Zeus believes he has found his thief . ”
41717	41731	41734	41734	Grover	252	“ But I ’ve never even been to Olympus ! Zeus is crazy ! ”
41773	41781	41782	41782	Grover	252	“ Er , Percy . . . ? ”
41785	41802	41782	41782	Grover	252	“ We do n’t use the c - word to describe the Lord of the Sky . ”
41803	41807	41808	41808	Chiron	279	“ Perhaps paranoid , ”
41811	41839	41840	41840	He	279	“ Then again , Poseidon has tried to unseat Zeus before . I believe that was question thirty - eight on your final exam . . . . ”
41894	41901	41902	41902	I	0	“ Something about a golden net ? ”
41905	41940	41902	41902	I	0	“ Poseidon and Hera and a few other gods . . . they , like , trapped Zeus and would n’t let him out until he promised to be a better ruler , right ? ”
41941	41944	41945	41945	Chiron	279	“ Correct , ”
41948	42002	41945	41945	Chiron	279	“ And Zeus has never trusted Poseidon since . Of course , Poseidon denies stealing the master bolt . He took great offense at the accusation . The two have been arguing back and forth for months , threatening war . And now , you ’ve come along — the proverbial last straw . ”
42003	42011	41902	41902	I	0	“ But I ’m just a kid ! ”
42012	42015	42016	42016	Grover	252	“ Percy , ”
42020	42087	42016	42016	Grover	252	“ if you were Zeus , and you already thought your brother was plotting to overthrow you , then your brother suddenly admitted he had broken the sacred oath he took after World War II , that he ’s fathered a new mortal hero who might be used as a weapon against you . . . . Would n’t that put a twist in your toga ? ”
42088	42114	41902	41902	I	0	“ But I did n’t do anything . Poseidon — my dad — he did n’t really have this master bolt stolen , did he ? ”
42118	42261	42115	42115	Chiron	279	“ Most thinking observers would agree that thievery is not Poseidon ’s style . But the Sea God is too proud to try convincing Zeus of that . Zeus has demanded that Poseidon return the bolt by the summer solstice . That ’s June twenty - first , ten days from now . Poseidon wants an apology for being called a thief by the same date . I hoped that diplomacy might prevail , that Hera or Demeter or Hestia would make the two brothers see sense . But your arrival has inflamed Zeus ’s temper . Now neither god will back down . Unless someone intervenes , unless the master bolt is found and returned to Zeus before the solstice , there will be war . And do you know what a full - fledged war would look like , Percy ? ”
42262	42265	42266	42266	I	0	“ Bad ? ”
42269	42321	42115	42115	Chiron	279	“ Imagine the world in chaos . Nature at war with itself . Olympians forced to choose sides between Zeus and Poseidon . Destruction . Carnage . Millions dead . Western civilization turned into a battleground so big it will make the Trojan War look like a water - balloon fight . ”
42322	42325	42326	42326	I	0	“ Bad , ”
42329	42346	42115	42115	Chiron	279	“ And you , Percy Jackson , would be the first to feel Zeus ’s wrath . ”
42391	42401	42402	42402	I	0	“ So I have to find the stupid bolt , ”
42405	42412	42402	42402	I	0	“ And return it to Zeus . ”

42423	42436	42420	42420	Chiron	279	“ than to have the son of Poseidon return Zeus ’s property ? ”
42437	42450	42402	42402	I	0	“ If Poseidon does n’t have it , where is the thing ? ”
42451	42457	42458	42458	Chiron	279	“ I believe I know . ”
42464	42513	42458	42458	Chiron	279	“ Part of a prophecy I had years ago . . . well , some of the lines make sense to me , now . But before I can say more , you must officially take up the quest . You must seek the counsel of the Oracle . ”
42514	42527	42458	42458	Chiron	279	“ Why ca n’t you tell me where the bolt is beforehand ? ”
42528	42544	42458	42458	Chiron	279	“ Because if I did , you would be too afraid to accept the challenge . ”
42548	42552	42545	42545	I	0	“ Good reason . ”
42553	42558	42458	42458	Chiron	279	“ You agree then ? ”

42589	42600	42586	42586	I	0	“ It ’s better than being turned into a dolphin . ”
42601	42611	42612	42612	Chiron	279	“ Then it ’s time you consulted the Oracle , ”
42615	42643	42612	42612	Chiron	279	“ Go upstairs , Percy Jackson , to the attic . When you come back down , assuming you ’re still sane , we will talk more . ”

43394	43412	43391	43391	I	0	“ Wait ! What do you mean ? What friend ? What will I fail to save ? ”
43498	43501	43502	43502	Chiron	279	“ Well ? ”
43516	43526	43506	43506	I	0	“ She said I would retrieve what was stolen . ”

43548	43556	43557	43557	Chiron	279	“ What did the Oracle say exactly ? ”
43560	43565	43557	43557	Chiron	279	“ This is important . ”
43576	43607	43566	43566	My	0	“ She . . . she said I would go west and face a god who had turned . I would retrieve what was stolen and see it safely returned . ”

43623	43627	43617	43617	Chiron	279	“ Anything else ? ”

43712	43751	43707	43707	He	279	“ Very well , Percy . But know this : the Oracle ’s words often have double meanings . Do n’t dwell on them too much . The truth is not always clear until events come to pass . ”
43775	43778	43779	43779	I	0	“ Okay , ”
43787	43802	43779	43779	I	0	“ So where do I go ? Who ’s this god in the west ? ”

43832	43841	43842	43842	I	0	“ Somebody else who wants to take over ? ”
43845	43909	43811	43811	Chiron	279	“ Yes , quite . Someone who harbors a grudge , who has been unhappy with his lot since the world was divided eons ago , whose kingdom would grow powerful with the deaths of millions . Someone who hates his brothers for forcing him into an oath to have no more children , an oath that both of them have now broken . ”
43927	43930	43910	43910	I	0	“ Hades . ”

43967	43974	43975	43975	Chiron	279	“ A Fury came after Percy , ”
43979	44007	43975	43975	Chiron	279	“ She watched the young man until she was sure of his identity , then tried to kill him . Furies obey only one lord : Hades . ”
44008	44019	44020	44020	Grover	252	“ Yes , but — but Hades hates all heroes , ”
44023	44040	44020	44020	Grover	252	“ Especially if he has found out Percy is a son of Poseidon . . . . ”

44053	44118	44050	44050	Chiron	279	“ Those can only be summoned from the Fields of Punishment , and it had to be summoned by someone within the camp . Hades must have a spy here . He must suspect Poseidon will try to use Percy to clear his name . Hades would very much like to kill this young half - blood before he can take on the quest . ”
44119	44122	44123	44123	I	0	“ Great , ”
44126	44138	44123	44123	I	0	“ That ’s two major gods who want to kill me . ”

44177	44188	44189	44189	Chiron	279	“ Hades sent a minion to steal the master bolt , ”
44192	44258	44189	44189	Chiron	279	“ He hid it in the Underworld , knowing full well that Zeus would blame Poseidon . I do n’t pretend to understand the Lord of the Dead ’s motives perfectly , or why he chose this time to start a war , but one thing is certain . Percy must go to the Underworld , find the master bolt , and reveal the truth . ”
44449	44459	44460	44460	I	0	“ Look , if we know it ’s Hades , ”
44464	44489	44460	44460	I	0	“ why ca n’t we just tell the other gods ? Zeus or Poseidon could go down to the Underworld and bust some heads . ”
44490	44499	44500	44500	Chiron	279	“ Suspecting and knowing are not the same , ”
44503	44602	44500	44500	Chiron	279	“ Besides , even if the other gods suspect Hades — and I imagine Poseidon does — they could n’t retrieve the bolt themselves . Gods can not cross each other ’s territories except by invitation . That is another ancient rule . Heroes , on the other hand , have certain privileges . They can go anywhere , challenge anyone , as long as they ’re bold enough and strong enough to do it . No god can be held responsible for a hero ’s actions . Why do you think the gods always operate through humans ? ”

44613	44646	44500	44500	Chiron	279	“ I ’m saying it ’s no accident Poseidon has claimed you now . It ’s a very risky gamble , but he ’s in a desperate situation . He needs you . ”
44699	44715	44694	44694	I	0	“ You ’ve known I was Poseidon ’s son all along , have n’t you ? ”
44716	44737	44746	44746	he	309	“ I had my suspicions . As I said . . . I ’ve spoken to the Oracle , too . ”
44777	44785	44786	44786	I	0	“ So let me get this straight , ”
44789	44805	44786	44786	I	0	“ I ’m supposed go to the Underworld and confront the Lord of the Dead . ”

44865	44879	44880	44880	he	252	“ Did I mention that Maine is very nice this time of year ? ”
44884	44892	44893	44893	I	0	“ You do n’t have to go , ”
44897	44906	44893	44893	I	0	“ I ca n’t ask that of you . ”

45069	45084	45064	45064	I	0	“ So where do we go ? The Oracle just said to go west . ”
45085	45119	45067	45067	Chiron	279	“ The entrance to the Underworld is always in the west . It moves from age to age , just like Olympus . Right now , of course , it ’s in America . ”

45128	45147	45124	45124	Chiron	279	“ I thought that would be obvious enough . The entrance to the Underworld is in Los Angeles . ”

45243	45294	45240	45240	Chiron	279	“ You are the son of the Sea God . Your father ’s bitterest rival is Zeus , Lord of the Sky . Your mother knew better than to trust you in an airplane . You would be in Zeus ’s domain . You would never come down again alive . ”
45303	45306	45307	45307	I	0	“ Okay , ”
45318	45326	45307	45307	I	0	“ So , I ’ll travel overland . ”

47164	47180	47156	47156	I	0	“ What do you mean it would n’t harm mortals ? How could it not ? ”
47181	47278	47156	47156	I	0	“ The sword is celestial bronze . Forged by the Cyclopes , tempered in the heart of Mount Etna , cooled in the River Lethe . It ’s deadly to monsters , to any creature from the Underworld , provided they do n’t kill you first . But the blade will pass through mortals like an illusion . They simply are not important enough for the blade to kill . And I should warn you : as a demigod , you can be killed by either celestial or normal weapons . You are twice as vulnerable . ”
47279	47284	47156	47156	I	0	“ Good to know . ”
47285	47291	47156	47156	I	0	“ Now recap the pen . ”

47411	47417	47407	47407	Chiron	279	“ Now check your pocket . ”
47426	47434	47435	47435	I	0	“ Okay , that ’s extremely cool , ”
47438	47451	47435	47435	I	0	“ But what if a mortal sees me pulling out a sword ? ”
47455	47464	47452	47452	Chiron	279	“ Mist is a powerful thing , Percy . ”
47465	47468	47452	47452	Chiron	279	“ Mist ? ”
47469	47550	47452	47452	Chiron	279	“ Yes . Read The Iliad . It ’s full of references to the stuff . Whenever divine or monstrous elements mix with the mortal world , they generate Mist , which obscures the vision of humans . You will see things just as they are , being a half - blood , but humans will interpret things quite differently . Remarkable , really , the lengths to which humans will go to fit things into their version of reality . ”
47643	47648	47649	47649	I	0	“ Chiron . . . ”
47652	47675	47649	47649	I	0	“ When you say the gods are immortal . . . I mean , there was a time before them , right ? ”
47676	47724	47598	47598	Chiron	279	“ Four ages before them , actually . The Time of the Titans was the Fourth Age , sometimes called the Golden Age , which is definitely a misnomer . This , the time of Western civilization and the rule of Zeus , is the Fifth Age . ”
47725	47738	47649	47649	I	0	“ So what was it like . . . before the gods ? ”
47744	47883	47741	47741	his	279	“ Even I am not old enough to remember that , child , but I know it was a time of darkness and savagery for mortals . Kronos , the lord of the Titans , called his reign the Golden Age because men lived innocent and free of all knowledge . But that was mere propaganda . The Titan king cared nothing for your kind except as appetizers or a source of cheap entertainment . It was only in the early reign of Lord Zeus , when Prometheus the good Titan brought fire to mankind , that your species began to progress , and even then Prometheus was branded a radical thinker . Zeus punished him severely , as you may recall . Of course , eventually the gods warmed to humans , and Western civilization was born . ”
47884	47932	47598	47598	Chiron	279	“ But the gods ca n’t die now , right ? I mean , as long as Western civilization is alive , they ’re alive . So . . . even if I failed , nothing could happen so bad it would mess up everything , right ? ”
47940	48041	47933	47933	Chiron	279	“ No one knows how long the Age of the West will last , Percy . The gods are immortal , yes . But then , so were the Titans . They still exist , locked away in their various prisons , forced to endure endless pain and punishment , reduced in power , but still very much alive . May the Fates forbid that the gods should ever suffer such a doom , or that we should ever return to the darkness and chaos of the past . All we can do , child , is follow our destiny . ”
48042	48055	48060	48060	Chiron	279	“ Our destiny . . . assuming we know what that is . ”
48056	48059	48060	48060	Chiron	279	“ Relax , ”
48064	48086	48060	48060	Chiron	279	“ Keep a clear head . And remember , you may be about to prevent the biggest war in human history . ”
48087	48090	48091	48091	I	0	“ Relax , ”
48094	48100	48091	48091	I	0	“ I ’m very relaxed . ”
48244	48250	48251	48251	I	0	“ So far so good , ”

48286	48299	48265	48265	She	266	“ Remind me again — why do you hate me so much ? ”
48300	48307	48265	48265	She	266	“ I do n’t hate you . ”
48308	48314	48265	48265	She	266	“ Could ’ve fooled me . ”
48322	48343	48315	48315	She	266	“ Look . . . we ’re just not supposed to get along , okay ? Our parents are rivals . ”
48344	48347	48348	48348	She	266	“ Why ? ”
48351	48431	48348	48348	She	266	“ How many reasons do you want ? One time my mom caught Poseidon with his girlfriend in Athena ’s temple , which is hugely disrespectful . Another time , Athena and Poseidon competed to be the patron god for the city of Athens . Your dad created some stupid saltwater spring for his gift . My mom created the olive tree . The people saw that her gift was better , so they named the city after her . ”
48432	48439	48315	48315	She	266	“ They must really like olives . ”
48440	48446	48348	48348	She	266	“ Oh , forget it . ”
48447	48461	48315	48315	She	266	“ Now , if she ’d invented pizza — that I could understand . ”
48462	48469	48348	48348	She	266	“ I said , forget it ! ”
48675	48687	48663	48663	He	252	“ You want to know why she married him , Percy ? ”

48703	48708	48709	48709	He	252	“ Just your emotions . ”
48712	48736	48709	48709	He	252	“ Guess I forgot to tell you satyrs can do that . You were thinking about your mom and your stepdad , right ? ”
48751	48759	48760	48760	Grover	252	“ Your mom married Gabe for you , ”
48764	48817	48760	48760	Grover	252	“ You call him ‘ Smelly , ’ but you ’ve got no idea . The guy has this aura . . . . Yuck . I can smell him from here . I can smell traces of him on you , and you have n’t been near him for a week . ”
48818	48821	48822	48822	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
48825	48832	48822	48822	I	0	“ Where ’s the nearest shower ? ”
48833	48939	48760	48760	Grover	252	“ You should be grateful , Percy . Your stepfather smells so repulsively human he could mask the presence of any demigod . As soon as I took a whiff inside his Camaro , I knew : Gabe has been covering your scent for years . If you had n’t lived with him every summer , you probably would ’ve been found by monsters a long time ago . Your mom stayed with him to protect you . She was a smart lady . She must ’ve loved you a lot to put up with that guy — if that makes you feel any better . ”
49297	49302	49303	49303	I	0	“ What is it ? ”
49306	49312	49313	49313	he	252	“ I do n’t know , ”

53757	53791	53719	53720	Aunty Em	344	“ Not so much , no . Since the highway was built . . . most cars , they do not go this way now . I must cherish every customer I get . ”

53914	53968	53972	53972	her	344	“ Oh , yes . Once upon a time , I had two sisters to help me in the business , but they have passed on , and Aunty Em is alone . I have only my statues . This is why I make them , you see . They are my company . ”

54006	54013	54014	54015	Aunty Em	344	“ It ’s a terrible story , ”
54018	54117	54014	54015	Aunty Em	344	“ Not one for children , really . You see , Annabeth , a bad woman was jealous of me , long ago , when I was young . I had a . . . a boyfriend , you know , and this bad woman was determined to break us apart . She caused a terrible accident . My sisters stayed by me . They shared my bad fortune as long as they could , but eventually they passed on . They faded away . I alone have survived , but at a price . Such a price . ”

54375	54402	54337	54338	Aunty Em	344	“ A photograph . I will use it to model a new statue set . Children are so popular , you see . Everyone loves children . ”

56756	56849	56749	56749	Annabeth	266	“ Your dad , actually . Do n’t you remember ? Medusa was Poseidon ’s girlfriend . They decided to meet in my mother ’s temple . That ’s why Athena turned her into a monster . Medusa and her two sisters who had helped her get into the temple , they became the three gorgons . That ’s why Medusa wanted to slice me up , but she wanted to preserve you as a nice statue . She ’s still sweet on your dad . You probably reminded her of him . ”

They ’ve been pillaging Pan ’s kingdom ever since . But for the satyrs , Pan was our lord and master . He protected us and the wild places of the earth . We refuse to believe that he died . In every generation , the bravest satyrs pledge their lives to finding Pan . They search the earth , exploring all the wildest places , hoping to find where he is hidden , and wake him from his sleep . ”

58083	58106	58073	58073	Grover	252	“ No searcher has ever come back . Once they set out , they disappear . They ’re never seen alive again . ”
58107	58115	57999	57999	he	1886	“ Not once in two thousand years ? ”

58170	58215	58073	58073	Grover	252	“ I have to believe that , Percy . Every searcher does . It ’s the only thing that keeps us from despair when we look at what humans have done to the world . I have to believe Pan can still be awakened . ”

58264	58277	58260	58260	I	0	“ I mean , what chance do we have against a god ? ”
58278	58284	58285	58285	he	252	“ I do n’t know , ”
58288	58307	58285	58285	he	252	“ But back at Medusa ’s , when you were searching her office ? Annabeth was telling me — ”
58308	58323	58260	58260	I	0	“ Oh , I forgot . Annabeth will have a plan all figured out . ”
58324	58359	58360	58360	His	252	“ Do n’t be so hard on her , Percy . She ’s had a tough life , but she ’s a good person . After all , she forgave me . . . . ”
58364	58370	58371	58371	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
58374	58380	58371	58371	I	0	“ Forgave you for what ? ”
58394	58399	58400	58400	I	0	“ Wait a minute , ”
58403	58437	58400	58400	I	0	“ Your first keeper job was five years ago . Annabeth has been at camp five years . She was n’t . . . I mean , your first assignment that went wrong — ”
58438	58446	58447	58447	Grover	252	“ I ca n’t talk about it , ”
58465	58498	58461	58461	I	0	“ But as I was saying , back at Medusa ’s , Annabeth and I agreed there ’s something strange going on with this quest . Something is n’t what it seems . ”
58499	58516	58400	58400	I	0	“ Well , duh . I ’m getting blamed for stealing a thunderbolt that Hades took . ”
58517	58525	58526	58526	Grover	252	“ That ’s not what I mean , ”
58529	58580	58526	58526	Grover	252	“ The Fur — The Kindly Ones were sort of holding back . Like Mrs. Dodds at Yancy Academy . . . why did she wait so long to try to kill you ? Then on the bus , they just were n’t as aggressive as they could ’ve been . ”
58581	58589	58400	58400	I	0	“ They seemed plenty aggressive to me . ”
58595	58610	58590	58590	Grover	252	“ They were screeching at us : ‘ Where is it ? Where ? ’ ”
58611	58616	58617	58617	I	0	“ Asking about me , ”
58620	58660	58400	58400	I	0	“ Maybe . . . but Annabeth and I , we both got the feeling they were n’t asking about a person . They said ‘ Where is it ? ’ They seemed to be asking about an object . ”
58661	58668	58590	58590	Grover	252	“ That does n’t make sense . ”
58669	58698	58699	58699	He	252	“ I know . But if we ’ve misunderstood something about this quest , and we only have nine days to find the master bolt . . . . ”
58743	58752	58753	58753	I	0	“ I have n’t been straight with you , ”
58757	58782	58753	58753	I	0	“ I do n’t care about the master bolt . I agreed to go to the Underworld so I could bring back my mother . ”
58792	58809	58783	58783	Grover	252	“ I know that , Percy . But are you sure that ’s the only reason ? ”
58810	58835	58789	58789	his	252	“ I ’m not doing it to help my father . He does n’t care about me . I do n’t care about him . ”
58844	58922	58836	58836	Grover	252	“ Look , Percy , I ’m not as smart as Annabeth . I ’m not as brave as you . But I ’m pretty good at reading emotions . You ’re glad your dad is alive . You feel good that he ’s claimed you , and part of you wants to make him proud . That ’s why you mailed Medusa ’s head to Olympus . You wanted him to notice what you ’d done . ”
58923	58949	58789	58789	his	252	“ Yeah ? Well maybe satyr emotions work differently than human emotions . Because you ’re wrong . I do n’t care what he thinks . ”
58959	58966	58950	58950	Grover	252	“ Okay , Percy . Whatever . ”
58967	58999	58789	58789	his	252	“ Besides , I have n’t done anything worth bragging about . We barely got out of New York and we ’re stuck here with no money and no way west . ”
59015	59030	59008	59008	he	252	“ How about I take first watch , huh ? You get some sleep . ”
59444	59447	59448	59448	Annabeth	266	“ Well , ”
59451	59456	59448	59448	Annabeth	266	“ the zombie lives . ”
59478	59485	59464	59464	I	0	“ How long was I asleep ? ”
59486	59495	59496	59496	Annabeth	266	“ Long enough for me to cook breakfast . ”
59514	59527	59496	59496	Annabeth	266	“ And Grover went exploring . Look , he found a friend . ”
59583	59590	59580	59580	Grover	252	“ No , he ’s not . ”
59594	59605	59591	59591	I	0	“ Are you . . . talking to that thing ? ”
59610	59614	59615	59615	Grover	252	“ This thing , ”
59618	59629	59615	59615	Grover	252	“ is our ticket west . Be nice to him . ”
59630	59637	59606	59607	The poodle	1908	“ You can talk to animals ? ”
59643	59653	59638	59638	Grover	252	“ Percy , meet Gladiola . Gladiola , Percy . ”
59680	59691	59692	59692	I	0	“ I ’m not saying hello to a pink poodle , ”
59695	59699	59692	59692	I	0	“ Forget it . ”
59700	59703	59704	59704	Annabeth	266	“ Percy , ”
59707	59722	59704	59704	Annabeth	266	“ I said hello to the poodle . You say hello to the poodle . ”
59798	59807	59808	59808	I	0	“ How does Gladiola know about the reward ? ”
59811	59817	59818	59818	Grover	252	“ He read the signs , ”
59821	59824	59818	59818	Grover	252	“ Duh . ”
59825	59829	59830	59830	I	0	“ Of course , ”
59833	59837	59830	59830	I	0	“ Silly me . ”
59838	59845	59846	59846	Annabeth	266	“ So we turn in Gladiola , ”
59854	59869	59849	59849	her	266	“ we get money , and we buy tickets to Los Angeles . Simple . ”
59913	59918	59919	59919	I	0	“ Not another bus , ”
59923	59926	59927	59927	Annabeth	266	“ No , ”
59950	59973	59930	59930	She	266	“ There ’s an Amtrack station half a mile that way . According to Gladiola , the westbound train leaves at noon . ”
60214	60219	60220	60220	Annabeth	266	“ Do n’t worry , ”
60224	60232	60220	60220	Annabeth	266	“ Mortal police could never find us . ”
60509	60512	60513	60513	Annabeth	266	“ So , ”
60526	60532	60513	60513	Annabeth	266	“ Who wants your help ? ”
60533	60539	60513	60513	Annabeth	266	“ What do you mean ? ”
60540	60565	60513	60513	Annabeth	266	“ When you were asleep just now , you mumbled , ‘ I wo n’t help you . ’ Who were you dreaming about ? ”
60608	60629	60600	60600	Annabeth	266	“ That does n’t sound like Hades . He always appears on a black throne , and he never laughs . ”
60630	60644	60598	60598	her	266	“ He offered my mother in trade . Who else could do that ? ”
60645	60688	60600	60600	Annabeth	266	“ I guess . . . if he meant , ‘ Help me rise from the Underworld . ’ If he wants war with the Olympians . But why ask you to bring him the master bolt if he already has it ? ”
60761	60801	60751	60751	Annabeth	266	“ Percy , you ca n’t barter with Hades . You know that , right ? He ’s deceitful , heartless , and greedy . I do n’t care if his Kindly Ones were n’t as aggressive this time — ”
60802	60806	60807	60807	I	0	“ This time ? ”
60810	60820	60807	60807	I	0	“ You mean you ’ve run into them before ? ”
60855	60885	60829	60829	She	266	“ Let ’s just say I ’ve got no love for the Lord of the Dead . You ca n’t be tempted to make a deal for your mom . ”
60886	60897	60829	60829	She	266	“ What would you do if it was your dad ? ”
60898	60903	60904	60904	she	266	“ That ’s easy , ”
60907	60915	60904	60904	she	266	“ I ’d leave him to rot . ”
60916	60922	60923	60923	Annabeth	266	“ You ’re not serious ? ”
60955	60970	60971	60971	she	266	“ My dad ’s resented me since the day I was born , Percy , ”
60974	61027	60971	60971	she	266	“ He never wanted a baby . When he got me , he asked Athena to take me back and raise me on Olympus because he was too busy with his work . She was n’t happy about that . She told him heroes had to be raised by their mortal parent . ”
61028	61050	60923	60923	Annabeth	266	“ But how . . . I mean , I guess you were n’t born in a hospital . . . . ”
61051	61163	60971	60971	she	266	“ I appeared on my father ’s doorstep , in a golden cradle , carried down from Olympus by Zephyr the West Wind . You ’d think my dad would remember that as a miracle , right ? Like , maybe he ’d take some digital photos or something . But he always talked about my arrival as if it were the most inconvenient thing that had ever happened to him . When I was five he got married and totally forgot about Athena . He got a ‘ regular ’ mortal wife , and had two ‘ regular ’ mortal kids , and tried to pretend I did n’t exist . ”
61196	61205	61206	61206	I	0	“ My mom married a really awful guy , ”
61210	61240	61206	61206	I	0	“ Grover said she did it to protect me , to hide me in the scent of a human family . Maybe that ’s what your dad was thinking . ”
61287	61295	61296	61296	she	266	“ He does n’t care about me , ”
61299	61378	61296	61296	she	266	“ His wife — my stepmom — treated me like a freak . She would n’t let me play with her children . My dad went along with her . Whenever something dangerous happened — you know , something with monsters — they would both look at me resentfully , like , ‘ How dare you put our family at risk . ’ Finally , I took the hint . I was n’t wanted . I ran away . ”
61379	61385	61465	61465	Annabeth	266	“ How old were you ? ”
61386	61397	61296	61296	she	266	“ Same age as when I started camp . Seven . ”
61398	61419	61465	61465	Annabeth	266	“ But . . . you could n’t have gotten all the way to Half - Blood Hill by yourself . ”
61420	61456	61296	61296	she	266	“ Not alone , no . Athena watched over me , guided me toward help . I made a couple of unexpected friends who took care of me , for a short time , anyway . ”
61557	61564	61565	61565	she	266	“ I want to do that , ”
61568	61571	61572	61572	I	0	“ What ? ”
61575	61589	61532	61532	Annabeth	266	“ Build something like that . You ever see the Parthenon , Percy ? ”
61590	61595	61534	61534	her	266	“ Only in pictures . ”
61596	61630	61532	61532	Annabeth	266	“ Someday , I ’m going to see it in person . I ’m going to build the greatest monument to the gods , ever . Something that ’ll last a thousand years . ”
61634	61640	61631	61631	I	0	“ You ? An architect ? ”
61671	61701	61667	61667	Her	266	“ Yes , an architect . Athena expects her children to create things , not just tear them down , like a certain god of earthquakes I could mention . ”
61713	61716	61717	61717	Annabeth	266	“ Sorry , ”
61720	61725	61717	61717	Annabeth	266	“ That was mean . ”
61726	61735	61736	61736	I	0	“ Ca n’t we work together a little ? ”
61739	61751	61736	61736	I	0	“ I mean , did n’t Athena and Poseidon ever cooperate ? ”
61759	61768	61769	61769	she	266	“ I guess . . . the chariot , ”
61773	61801	61769	61769	she	266	“ My mom invented it , but Poseidon created horses out of the crests of waves . So they had to work together to make it complete . ”
61802	61812	61813	61813	We	1958	“ Then we can cooperate , too . Right ? ”
61829	61833	61834	61834	she	266	“ I suppose , ”
61877	61880	61874	61874	he	252	“ Food . ”
61881	61888	61889	61889	Annabeth	266	“ Come on , goat boy , ”
61892	61895	61889	61889	Annabeth	266	“ Sightseeing . ”
61896	61899	61874	61874	he	252	“ Sightseeing ? ”
61900	61905	61906	61906	she	266	“ The Gateway Arch , ”
61909	61928	61906	61906	she	266	“ This may be my only chance to ride to the top . Are you coming or not ? ”
61963	61975	61960	61960	Grover	252	“ As long as there ’s a snack bar without monsters . ”
62069	62074	62075	62075	I	0	“ You smell anything ? ”
62096	62099	62100	62100	he	252	“ Underground , ”
62104	62118	62100	62100	he	252	“ Underground air always smells like monsters . Probably does n’t mean anything . ”
62136	62139	62140	62140	I	0	“ Guys , ”
62143	62153	62140	62140	I	0	“ You know the gods ’ symbols of power ? ”
62177	62180	62173	62173	she	266	“ Yeah ? ”
62181	62186	62140	62140	I	0	“ Well , Hade — ”
62192	62210	62189	62189	his	252	“ We ’re in a public place . . . . You mean , our friend downstairs ? ”
62211	62216	62217	62217	I	0	“ Um , right , ”
62220	62236	62217	62217	I	0	“ Our friend way downstairs . Does n’t he have a hat like Annabeth ’s ? ”
62237	62245	62246	62246	Annabeth	266	“ You mean the Helm of Darkness , ”
62249	62273	62246	62246	Annabeth	266	“ Yeah , that ’s his symbol of power . I saw it next to his seat during the winter solstice council meeting . ”
62274	62279	62280	62280	I	0	“ He was there ? ”
62286	62330	62283	62283	She	266	“ It ’s the only time he ’s allowed to visit Olympus — the darkest day of the year . But his helm is a lot more powerful than my invisibility hat , if what I ’ve heard is true . . . . ”
62331	62339	62340	62340	Grover	252	“ It allows him to become darkness , ”
62343	62394	62340	62340	Grover	252	“ He can melt into shadow or pass through walls . He ca n’t be touched , or seen , or heard . And he can radiate fear so intense it can drive you insane or stop your heart . Why do you think all rational creatures fear the dark ? ”
62395	62415	62416	62416	I	0	“ But then . . . how do we know he ’s not here right now , watching us ? ”
62425	62430	62431	62431	Grover	252	“ We do n’t , ”
62434	62445	62446	62446	I	0	“ Thanks , that makes me feel a lot better , ”
62449	62457	62446	62446	I	0	“ Got any blue jelly beans left ? ”

62626	62631	62632	62632	Annabeth	266	“ They ’re below , ”
62636	62641	62632	62632	Annabeth	266	“ Scared of heights . ”
62642	62649	62697	62698	the lady	1985	“ Oh , the poor darlings . ”
62658	62667	62654	62655	The woman	1816	“ Now , now , sonny . Behave . ”

63140	63152	63122	63124	the fat lady	1982	“ Um , did you just call that Chihuahua your son ? ”
63153	63158	63159	63161	the fat lady	1982	“ Chimera , dear , ”
63164	63177	63159	63161	the fat lady	1982	“ Not a Chihuahua . It ’s an easy mistake to make . ”
63442	63476	63429	63431	The snake lady	2017	“ Be honored , Percy Jackson . Lord Zeus rarely allows me to test a hero with one of my brood . For I am the Mother of Monsters , the terrible Echidna ! ”
63490	63499	63477	63477	I	0	“ Is n’t that a kind of anteater ? ”
63513	63545	63500	63500	She	2017	“ I hate it when people say that ! I hate Australia ! Naming that ridiculous animal after me . For that , Percy Jackson , my son shall destroy you ! ”
63617	63622	63600	63600	I	0	“ Hey , Chihuahua ! ”
63984	63999	63976	63978	The snake lady	2017	“ They do n’t make heroes like they used to , eh , son ? ”
64142	64151	64152	64152	Echidna	360	“ If you are the son of Poseidon , ”
64155	64186	64152	64152	Echidna	360	“ you would not fear water . Jump , Percy Jackson . Show me that water will not harm you . Jump and retrieve your sword . Prove your bloodline . ”

64248	64282	64244	64244	Echidna	360	“ You do not trust the gods . I can not blame you , little coward . Better you die now . The gods are faithless . The poison is in your heart . ”

65716	65773	65707	65709	A news lady	2092	“ Probably not a terrorist attack , we ’re told , but it ’s still very early in the investigation . The damage , as you can see , is very serious . We ’re trying to get to some of the survivors , to question them about eyewitness reports of someone falling from the Arch . ”

Hard to believe , John , but that ’s what we ’re hearing . Again , no confirmed fatalities . . . ”

66003	66009	65972	65972	him	252	“ I sort of fell . ”
66010	66019	65981	65981	she	266	“ Percy ! Six hundred and thirty feet ? ”

66073	66087	66069	66069	She	2105	“ And then this huge dog , this huge fire - breathing Chihuahua — ”

66098	66116	66094	66095	the paramedic	2108	“ Just calm down . Your family is fine . The medication is starting to kick in . ”
66117	66135	66137	66137	she	2105	“ I ’m not crazy ! This boy jumped out of the hole and the monster disappeared . ”
66141	66151	66137	66137	she	2105	“ There he is ! That ’s the boy ! ”

66179	66190	66176	66176	Annabeth	266	“ Was she talking about the Chihuahua on the elevator ? ”
66216	66219	66221	66221	Grover	252	“ Whoa , ”
66223	66244	66221	66221	Grover	252	“ We ’ve got to get you to Santa Monica ! You ca n’t ignore a summons from your dad . ”
66270	66338	66267	66267	he	2097	“ Percy Jackson . That ’s right , Dan . Channel Twelve has learned that the boy who may have caused this explosion fits the description of a young man wanted by authorities for a serious New Jersey bus accident three days ago . And the boy is believed to be traveling west . For our viewers at home , here is a photo of Percy Jackson . ”

66493	66507	66490	66490	Annabeth	266	“ I want to tell him about your talk with the river spirit . ”
66508	66517	66543	66543	Annabeth	266	“ We ca n’t use phones , right ? ”
66518	66526	66490	66490	Annabeth	266	“ I ’m not talking about phones . ”
66649	66656	66657	66657	I	0	“ What exactly are we doing ? ”
66668	66676	66677	66677	he	252	“ It ’s seventy - five cents , ”

66746	66775	66743	66743	Grover	252	“ We could do it with a spray bottle , of course , but the connection is n’t as good , and my arm gets tired of pumping . ”

66817	66852	66814	66814	Annabeth	266	“ The rainbow goddess Iris carries messages for the gods . If you know how to ask , and she ’s not too busy , she ’ll do the same for half - bloods . ”
66853	66863	66743	66743	Grover	252	“ You summon the goddess with a spray gun ? ”
66881	66893	66864	66864	Grover	252	“ Unless you know an easier way to make a rainbow . ”

67126	67138	67142	67142	She	266	“ We ’re . . . uh . . . fine , ”
67163	67172	67142	67142	She	266	“ We thought — Chiron — I mean — ”
67173	67181	67182	67182	Luke	288	“ He ’s down at the cabins . ”
67187	67210	67182	67182	Luke	288	“ We ’re having some issues with the campers . Listen , is everything cool with you ? Is Grover all right ? ”
67211	67217	67218	67218	Grover	252	“ I ’m right here , ”
67238	67244	67221	67221	He	252	“ What kind of issues ? ”
67289	67299	67300	67300	Luke	288	“ Chiron had to — what ’s that noise ? ”
67303	67311	67312	67312	Annabeth	266	“ I ’ll take care of it ! ”
67329	67335	67312	67312	Annabeth	266	“ Grover , come on ! ”
67336	67339	67340	67340	Grover	252	“ What ? ”
67343	67346	67340	67340	Grover	252	“ But — ”
67347	67356	67357	67357	she	266	“ Give Percy the nozzle and come on ! ”
67402	67411	67412	67412	Luke	288	“ Chiron had to break up a fight , ”
67420	67495	67412	67412	Luke	288	“ Things are pretty tense here , Percy . Word leaked out about the Zeus – Poseidon standoff . We ’re still not sure how — probably the same scumbag who summoned the hellhound . Now the campers are starting to take sides . It ’s shaping up like the Trojan War all over again . Aphrodite , Ares , and Apollo are backing Poseidon , more or less . Athena is backing Zeus . ”
67539	67546	67547	67547	Luke	288	“ So what ’s your status ? ”
67551	67560	67547	67547	Luke	288	“ Chiron will be sorry he missed you . ”
67629	67637	67638	67638	Luke	288	“ I wish I could be there , ”
67642	67692	67638	67638	Luke	288	“ We ca n’t help much from here , I ’m afraid , but listen . . . it had to be Hades who took the master bolt . He was there at Olympus at the winter solstice . I was chaperoning a field trip and we saw him . ”
67693	67709	67768	67768	he	288	“ But Chiron said the gods ca n’t take each other ’s magic items directly . ”
67710	67715	67716	67716	Luke	288	“ That ’s true , ”
67722	67756	67716	67716	Luke	288	“ Still . . . Hades has the helm of darkness . How could anybody else sneak into the throne room and steal the master bolt ? You ’d have to be invisible . ”
67772	67777	67778	67778	he	288	“ Oh , hey , ”
67781	67815	67778	67778	he	288	“ I did n’t mean Annabeth . She and I have known each other forever . She would never . . . I mean , she ’s like a little sister to me . ”
67857	67867	67868	67868	Luke	288	“ You ’d better go see what that was , ”
67871	67895	67868	67868	Luke	288	“ Listen , are you wearing the flying shoes ? I ’ll feel better if I know they ’ve done you some good . ”
67896	67905	67906	67906	I	0	“ Oh . . . uh , yeah ! ”
67916	67925	67906	67906	I	0	“ Yeah , they ’ve come in handy . ”

67933	67939	67930	67930	He	288	“ They fit and everything ? ”
67951	67963	67964	67964	Luke	288	“ Well , take care of yourself out there in Denver , ”
67972	67995	67967	67967	his	288	“ And tell Grover it ’ll be better this time ! Nobody will get turned into a pine tree if he just — ”
68045	68056	68040	68040	Annabeth	266	“ What happened , Percy ? What did Luke say ? ”
68057	68061	68062	68062	I	0	“ Not much , ”
68076	68086	68062	68062	I	0	“ Come on , let ’s find some dinner . ”

68607	68618	68600	68600	He	2175	“ So you ’re old Seaweed ’s kid , huh ? ”
68652	68659	68642	68642	I	0	“ What ’s it to you ? ”
68668	68674	68660	68660	Annabeth	266	“ Percy , this is — ”
68681	68684	68685	68685	he	2175	“ S’okay , ”
68688	68715	68685	68685	he	2175	“ I do n’t mind a little attitude . Long as you remember who ’s the boss . You know who I am , little cousin ? ”

68796	68811	68861	68862	The waitress	2164	“ That ’s right , punk . I heard you broke Clarisse ’s spear . ”
68812	68819	68882	68882	Ares	294	“ She was asking for it . ”
68820	68860	68861	68862	The waitress	2164	“ Probably . That ’s cool . I do n’t fight my kids ’ fights , you know ? What I ’m here for — I heard you were in town . I got a little proposition for you . ”
68897	68906	68890	68890	She	2164	“ But , these are n’t . . . ”
68919	68924	68907	68907	Ares	294	“ Problem , sweetheart ? ”
68935	68942	68943	68943	I	0	“ You ca n’t do that , ”
68947	68958	68943	68943	I	0	“ You ca n’t just threaten people with a knife . ”
68962	69010	68959	68959	Ares	294	“ Are you kidding ? I love this country . Best place since Sparta . Do n’t you carry a weapon , punk ? You should . Dangerous world out there . Which brings me to my proposition . I need you to do me a favor . ”
69011	69021	68959	68959	Ares	294	“ What favor could I do for a god ? ”
69022	69085	68959	68959	Ares	294	“ Something a god does n’t have time to do himself . It ’s nothing much . I left my shield at an abandoned water park here in town . I was going on a little . . . date with my girlfriend . We were interrupted . I left my shield behind . I want you to fetch it for me . ”
69086	69098	68959	68959	Ares	294	“ Why do n’t you go back and get it yourself ? ”
69110	69157	69158	69158	He	2196	“ Why do n’t I turn you into prairie dog and run you over with my Harley ? Because I do n’t feel like it . A god is giving you an opportunity to prove yourself , Percy Jackson . Will you prove yourself a coward ? ”
69162	69184	69158	69158	He	2196	“ Or maybe you only fight when there ’s a river to dive into , so your daddy can protect you . ”
69229	69235	69236	69236	I	0	“ We ’re not interested , ”
69239	69247	69236	69236	I	0	“ We ’ve already got a quest . ”
69272	69322	69323	69323	He	294	“ I know all about your quest , punk . When that item was first stolen , Zeus sent his best out looking for it : Apollo , Athena , Artemis , and me , naturally . If I could n’t sniff out a weapon that powerful . . . ”
69341	69397	69325	69325	his	294	“ Well . . . if I could n’t find it , you got no hope . Nevertheless , I ’m trying to give you the benefit of the doubt . Your dad and I go way back . After all , I ’m the one who told him my suspicions about old Corpse Breath . ”
69398	69407	69544	69544	He	2198	“ You told him Hades stole the bolt ? ”
69408	69443	69325	69325	his	294	“ Sure . Framing somebody to start a war . Oldest trick in the book . I recognized it immediately . In a way , you got me to thank for your little quest . ”
69444	69447	69448	69448	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
69451	69487	69325	69325	his	294	“ Hey , I ’m a generous guy . Just do my little job , and I ’ll help you on your way . I ’ll arrange a ride west for you and your friends . ”
69488	69497	69325	69325	his	294	“ We ’re doing fine on our own . ”
69498	69538	69325	69325	his	294	“ Yeah , right . No money . No wheels . No clue what you ’re up against . Help me out , and maybe I ’ll tell you something you need to know . Something about your mom . ”
69539	69543	69325	69325	his	294	“ My mom ? ”
69547	69577	69544	69544	He	2198	“ That got your attention . The water park is a mile west on Delancy . You ca n’t miss it . Look for the Tunnel of Love ride . ”
69578	69584	69585	69585	I	0	“ What interrupted your date ? ”
69588	69594	69585	69585	I	0	“ Something scare you off ? ”
69624	69669	69620	69620	he	2198	“ You ’re lucky you met me , punk , and not one of the other Olympians . They ’re not as forgiving of rudeness as I am . I ’ll meet you back here when you ’re done . Do n’t disappoint me . ”
69716	69720	69721	69721	Grover	252	“ Not good , ”
69724	69737	69721	69721	Grover	252	“ Ares sought you out , Percy . This is not good . ”
69812	69821	69822	69822	I	0	“ It ’s probably some kind of trick , ”
69825	69834	69822	69822	I	0	“ Forget Ares . Let ’s just go . ”
69835	69840	69841	69841	Annabeth	266	“ We ca n’t , ”
69844	69880	69841	69841	Annabeth	266	“ Look , I hate Ares as much as anybody , but you do n’t ignore the gods unless you want serious bad fortune . He was n’t kidding about turning you into a rodent . ”
69896	69903	69881	69881	I	0	“ Why does he need us ? ”
69904	69914	69915	69915	Annabeth	266	“ Maybe it ’s a problem that requires brains , ”
69918	69938	69915	69915	Annabeth	266	“ Ares has strength . That ’s all he has . Even strength has to bow to wisdom sometimes . ”
69939	69963	69881	69881	I	0	“ But this water park . . . he acted almost scared . What would make a war god run away like that ? ”
69976	69987	69973	69973	Annabeth	266	“ I ’m afraid we ’ll have to find out . ”
70080	70091	70092	70092	I	0	“ If Ares brings his girlfriend here for a date , ”
70102	70113	70092	70092	I	0	“ I ’d hate to see what she looks like . ”

70121	70126	70118	70118	Annabeth	266	“ Be more respectful . ”
70127	70136	70092	70092	I	0	“ Why ? I thought you hated Ares . ”
70137	70151	70118	70118	Annabeth	266	“ He ’s still a god . And his girlfriend is very temperamental . ”
70152	70162	70163	70163	Grover	252	“ You do n’t want to insult her looks , ”
70166	70173	70163	70163	Grover	252	“ Who is she ? Echidna ? ”
70174	70179	70180	70180	Grover	252	“ No , Aphrodite , ”
70187	70192	70118	70118	Annabeth	266	“ Goddess of love . ”
70193	70202	70203	70203	I	0	“ I thought she was married to somebody , ”

70210	70216	70217	70217	he	252	“ What ’s your point ? ”
70220	70223	70217	70217	he	252	“ Oh . ”
70234	70242	70118	70118	Annabeth	266	“ So how do we get in ? ”
70243	70246	70247	70247	Grover	252	“ Maia ! ”
70291	70296	70276	70276	He	252	“ You guys coming ? ”
70399	70402	70403	70403	Annabeth	266	“ Clothes , ”
70406	70410	70403	70403	Annabeth	266	“ Fresh clothes . ”
70411	70414	70415	70415	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
70418	70425	70415	70415	I	0	“ But you ca n’t just — ”

70491	70496	70497	70497	Grover	252	“ What the heck . ”
70540	70546	70547	70547	I	0	“ So Ares and Aphrodite , ”

70680	70738	70677	70677	Annabeth	266	“ He caught them together once . I mean , literally caught them , in a golden net , and invited all the gods to come and laugh at them . Hephaestus is always trying to embarrass them . That ’s why they meet in out - of - the - way places , like . . . ”
70746	70750	70739	70739	She	266	“ Like that . ”

75052	75055	75056	75056	Annabeth	266	“ Hey , ”
75059	75074	75056	75056	Annabeth	266	“ I ’m sorry for freaking out back at the water park , Percy . ”
75075	75080	75126	75126	Annabeth	266	“ That ’s okay . ”
75081	75088	75089	75089	She	266	“ It ’s just . . . ”
75092	75095	75089	75089	She	266	“ Spiders . ”
75096	75103	75104	75104	I	0	“ Because of the Arachne story , ”
75107	75125	75104	75104	I	0	“ She got turned into a spider for challenging your mom to a weaving contest , right ? ”
75129	75174	75126	75126	Annabeth	266	“ Arachne ’s children have been taking revenge on the children of Athena ever since . If there ’s a spider within a mile of me , it ’ll find me . I hate the creepy little things . Anyway , I owe you . ”
75175	75183	75184	75184	I	0	“ We ’re a team , remember ? ”
75187	75196	75184	75184	I	0	“ Besides , Grover did the fancy flying . ”
75210	75220	75204	75204	he	2345	“ I was pretty amazing , was n’t I ? ”
75236	75250	75226	75226	She	266	“ In the Iris message . . . did Luke really say nothing ? ”
75272	75300	75226	75226	She	266	“ Luke said you and he go way back . He also said Grover would n’t fail this time . Nobody would turn into a pine tree . ”
75326	75338	75339	75339	His	252	“ I should ’ve told you the truth from the beginning . ”
75343	75362	75339	75339	His	252	“ I thought if you knew what a failure I was , you would n’t want me along . ”
75363	75379	75409	75409	Annabeth	266	“ You were the satyr who tried to rescue Thalia , the daughter of Zeus . ”
75384	75405	75406	75406	I	0	“ And the other two half - bloods Thalia befriended , the ones who got safely to camp . . . ”
75411	75422	75406	75406	I	0	“ That was you and Luke , was n’t it ? ”
75431	75526	75423	75423	She	266	“ Like you said , Percy , a seven - year - old half - blood would n’t have made it very far alone . Athena guided me toward help . Thalia was twelve . Luke was fourteen . They ’d both run away from home , like me . They were happy to take me with them . They were . . . amazing monster - fighters , even without training . We traveled north from Virginia without any real plans , fending off monsters for about two weeks before Grover found us . ”
75527	75537	75538	75538	he	2347	“ I was supposed to escort Thalia to camp , ”
75543	75644	75538	75538	he	2347	“ Only Thalia . I had strict orders from Chiron : do n’t do anything that would slow down the rescue . We knew Hades was after her , see , but I could n’t just leave Luke and Annabeth by themselves . I thought . . . I thought I could lead all three of them to safety . It was my fault the Kindly Ones caught up with us . I froze . I got scared on the way back to camp and took some wrong turns . If I ’d just been a little quicker . . . ”
75645	75649	75650	75650	Annabeth	266	“ Stop it , ”
75653	75666	75650	75650	Annabeth	266	“ No one blames you . Thalia did n’t blame you either . ”
75667	75675	75676	75676	he	2348	“ She sacrificed herself to save us , ”
75680	75695	75676	75676	he	2348	“ Her death was my fault . The Council of Cloven Elders said so . ”
75696	75709	75710	75710	I	0	“ Because you would n’t leave two other half - bloods behind ? ”
75713	75719	75710	75710	I	0	“ That ’s not fair . ”
75720	75725	75726	75726	Annabeth	266	“ Percy ’s right , ”
75729	75758	75726	75726	Annabeth	266	“ I would n’t be here today if it were n’t for you , Grover . Neither would Luke . We do n’t care what the council says . ”
75766	75798	75759	75759	Grover	252	“ It ’s just my luck . I ’m the lamest satyr ever , and I find the two most powerful half - bloods of the century , Thalia and Percy . ”
75799	75805	75806	75806	Annabeth	266	“ You ’re not lame , ”
75809	75846	75806	75806	Annabeth	266	“ You ’ve got more courage than any satyr I ’ve ever met . Name one other who would dare go to the Underworld . I bet Percy is really glad you ’re here right now . ”
75854	75857	75858	75858	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
75871	75914	75858	75858	I	0	“ It ’s not luck that you found Thalia and me , Grover . You ’ve got the biggest heart of any satyr ever . You ’re a natural searcher . That ’s why you ’ll be the one who finds Pan . ”
75952	75959	75960	75960	I	0	“ How does he do that ? ”
75963	75969	75970	75970	Annabeth	266	“ I do n’t know , ”
75973	75985	75970	75970	Annabeth	266	“ But that was really a nice thing you told him . ”
75986	75991	75992	75992	We	2349	“ I meant it . ”
76045	76052	76053	76053	I	0	“ That pine - tree bead , ”
76056	76064	76053	76053	I	0	“ Is that from your first year ? ”
76077	76080	76081	76081	she	266	“ Yeah , ”
76084	76140	76081	76081	she	266	“ Every August , the counselors pick the most important event of the summer , and they paint it on that year ’s beads . I ’ve got Thalia ’s pine tree , a Greek trireme on fire , a centaur in a prom dress — now that was a weird summer . . . . ”
76141	76151	76065	76065	She	266	“ And the college ring is your father ’s ? ”
76152	76159	76160	76160	She	266	“ That ’s none of your — ”
76164	76172	76160	76160	She	266	“ Yeah . Yeah , it is . ”
76173	76182	76065	76065	She	266	“ You do n’t have to tell me . ”
76183	76192	76193	76193	She	266	“ No . . . it ’s okay . ”
76199	76288	76193	76193	She	266	“ My dad sent it to me folded up in a letter , two summers ago . The ring was , like , his main keepsake from Athena . He would n’t have gotten through his doctoral program at Harvard without her . . . . That ’s a long story . Anyway , he said he wanted me to have it . He apologized for being a jerk , said he loved me and missed me . He wanted me to come home and live with him . ”
76289	76297	76065	76065	She	266	“ That does n’t sound so bad . ”
76298	76382	76193	76193	She	266	“ Yeah , well . . . the problem was , I believed him . I tried to go home for that school year , but my stepmom was the same as ever . She did n’t want her kids put in danger by living with a freak . Monsters attacked . We argued . Monsters attacked . We argued . I did n’t even make it through winter break . I called Chiron and came right back to Camp Half - Blood . ”
76383	76396	76065	76065	She	266	“ You think you ’ll ever try living with your dad again ? ”
76404	76416	76397	76397	She	2350	“ Please . I ’m not into self - inflicted pain . ”
76417	76424	76425	76425	I	0	“ You should n’t give up , ”
76429	76439	76425	76425	I	0	“ You should write him a letter or something . ”
76440	76446	76447	76447	she	2350	“ Thanks for the advice , ”
76451	76467	76447	76447	she	2350	“ but my father ’s made his choice about who he wants to live with . ”
76476	76483	76484	76484	I	0	“ So if the gods fight , ”
76487	76508	76484	76484	I	0	“ will things line up the way they did with the Trojan War ? Will it be Athena versus Poseidon ? ”
76526	76547	76509	76509	She	2350	“ I do n’t know what my mom will do . I just know I ’ll fight next to you . ”
76548	76551	76516	76516	Ares	294	“ Why ? ”
76552	76567	76509	76509	She	2350	“ Because you ’re my friend , Seaweed Brain . Any more stupid questions ? ”
77354	77360	77361	77361	he	252	“ The truck ’s stopped , ”
77364	77376	77361	77361	he	252	“ We think they ’re coming to check on the animals . ”
77377	77380	77381	77381	Annabeth	266	“ Hide ! ”
77427	77430	77438	77438	his	2389	“ Man ! ”

81317	81359	81312	81312	I	0	“ Something ’s wrong . The throne room was n’t the main part of the dream . And that voice from the pit . . . I do n’t know . It just did n’t feel like a god ’s voice . ”
81365	81368	81369	81369	I	0	“ What ? ”
81372	81412	81360	81360	Annabeth	266	“ Oh . . . nothing . I was just — No , it has to be Hades . Maybe he sent this thief , this invisible person , to get the master bolt , and something went wrong — ”
81413	81417	81360	81360	Annabeth	266	“ Like what ? ”
81418	81426	81427	81427	she	266	“ I — I do n’t know , ”
81430	81529	81427	81427	she	266	“ But if he stole Zeus ’s symbol of power from Olympus , and the gods were hunting him , I mean , a lot of things could go wrong . So this thief had to hide the bolt , or he lost it somehow . Anyway , he failed to bring it to Hades . That ’s what the voice said in your dream , right ? The guy failed . That would explain what the Furies were searching for when they came after us on the bus . Maybe they thought we had retrieved the bolt . ”
81544	81554	81555	81555	I	0	“ But if I ’d already retrieved the bolt , ”
81558	81568	81555	81555	I	0	“ why would I be traveling to the Underworld ? ”
81569	81574	81575	81575	Grover	252	“ To threaten Hades , ”
81578	81590	81575	81575	Grover	252	“ To bribe or blackmail him into getting your mom back . ”
81594	81603	81591	81591	I	0	“ You have evil thoughts for a goat . ”
81604	81610	81591	81591	I	0	“ Why , thank you . ”
81611	81626	81627	81627	I	0	“ But the thing in the pit said it was waiting for two items , ”

81675	81691	81692	81692	I	0	“ You have an idea what might be in that pit , do n’t you ? ”
81696	81706	81692	81692	I	0	“ I mean , if it is n’t Hades ? ”
81707	81736	81694	81694	her	266	“ Percy . . . let ’s not talk about it . Because if it is n’t Hades . . . No . It has to be Hades . ”
81890	81898	81899	81899	Annabeth	266	“ The answer is in the Underworld , ”
81903	81929	81899	81899	Annabeth	266	“ You saw spirits of the dead , Percy . There ’s only one place that could be . We ’re doing the right thing . ”
82105	82109	82110	82110	Annabeth	266	“ What now ? ”
82207	82210	82211	82211	Annabeth	266	“ Percy ? ”
82214	82220	82211	82211	Annabeth	266	“ What are you doing ? ”
82239	82255	82234	82234	She	266	“ You know how polluted that water is ? There ’re all kinds of toxic — ”
82605	82609	82593	82594	A woman	2057	“ Percy Jackson . ”

82727	82781	82679	82681	The underwater lady	2112	“ Yes , child . I am a Nereid , a spirit of the sea . It was not easy to appear so far upriver , but the naiads , my freshwater cousins , helped sustain my life force . They honor Lord Poseidon , though they do not serve in his court . ”
82782	82794	82709	82709	I	0	“ And . . . you serve in Poseidon ’s court ? ”
82798	82823	82795	82795	She	2545	“ It has been many years since a child of the Sea God has been born . We have watched you with great interest . ”
82866	82876	82877	82877	I	0	“ If my father is so interested in me , ”
82880	82895	82877	82877	I	0	“ why is n’t he here ? Why does n’t he speak to me ? ”
82905	82917	82918	82919	the Nereid	390	“ Do not judge the Lord of the Sea too harshly , ”
82923	82960	82918	82919	the Nereid	390	“ He stands at the brink of an unwanted war . He has much to occupy his time . Besides , he is forbidden to help you directly . The gods may not show such favoritism . ”
82961	82968	82997	82997	She	2548	“ Even to their own children ? ”
82969	82996	82918	82919	the Nereid	390	“ Especially to them . The gods can work by indirect influence only . That is why I give you a warning , and a gift . ”
83011	83021	83022	83022	she	2548	“ I know you journey to Hades ’s realm , ”
83025	83067	83022	83022	she	2548	“ Few mortals have ever done this and survived : Orpheus , who had great music skill ; Hercules , who had great strength ; Houdini , who could escape even the depths of Tartarus . Do you have these talents ? ”
83068	83077	82997	82997	She	2548	“ Um . . . no , ma’am . ”
83078	83145	83022	83022	she	2548	“ Ah , but you have something else , Percy . You have gifts you have only begun to know . The oracles have foretold a great and terrible future for you , should you survive to manhood . Poseidon would not have you die before your time . Therefore take these , and when you are in need , smash a pearl at your feet . ”
83146	83151	82997	82997	She	2548	“ What will happen ? ”
83152	83155	83156	83156	she	2549	“ That , ”
83159	83180	83156	83156	she	2549	“ depends on the need . But remember : what belongs to the sea will always return to the sea . ”
83181	83187	82997	82997	She	2548	“ What about the warning ? ”
83195	83256	83188	83188	Her	2549	“ Go with what your heart tells you , or you will lose all . Hades feeds on doubt and hopelessness . He will trick you if he can , make you mistrust your own judgment . Once you are in his realm , he will never willingly let you leave . Keep faith . Good luck , Percy Jackson . ”
83268	83271	83272	83272	I	0	“ Wait ! ”
83275	83291	83272	83272	I	0	“ At the river , you said not to trust the gifts . What gifts ? ”
83292	83300	83301	83301	she	2549	“ Good - bye , young hero , ”
83312	83320	83301	83301	she	2549	“ You must listen to your heart . ”
83416	83424	83413	83413	Annabeth	266	“ No gift comes without a price . ”
83425	83430	83413	83413	Annabeth	266	“ They were free . ”
83431	83434	83435	83435	She	266	“ No . ”
83440	83475	83437	83437	her	266	“ ‘ There is no such thing as a free lunch . ’ That ’s an ancient Greek saying that translated pretty well into American . There will be a price . You wait . ”
83535	83546	83547	83547	he	659	“ You remind me of somebody I saw on TV , ”
83551	83559	83547	83547	he	659	“ You a child actor or something ? ”
83560	83580	83591	83591	him	659	“ Uh . . . I ’m a stunt double . . . for a lot of child actors . ”
83581	83588	83591	83591	him	659	“ Oh ! That explains it . ”
83734	83788	83730	83730	He	659	“ Honest , Ms. Walters , if it was n’t for Sugar here , my grief counselor , I ’d be a wreck . My stepson took everything I cared about . My wife . . . my Camaro . . . I — I’m sorry . I have trouble talking about it . ”
83789	83797	83798	83799	Barbara Walters	391	“ There you have it , America . ”
83805	83842	83798	83799	Barbara Walters	391	“ A man torn apart . An adolescent boy with serious issues . Let me show you , again , the last known photo of this troubled young fugitive , taken a week ago in Denver . ”
83867	83877	83878	83879	Barbara Walters	391	“ Who are the other children in this photo ? ”
83883	83929	83878	83879	Barbara Walters	391	“ Who is the man with them ? Is Percy Jackson a delinquent , a terrorist , or perhaps the brainwashed victim of a frightening new cult ? When we come back , we chat with a leading child psychologist . Stay tuned , America . ”
83930	83934	83935	83935	Grover	252	“ C’m on , ”
84184	84189	84177	84181	a voice from the darkness	2584	“ Hey , you . ”
84319	84325	84315	84315	He	3666	“ What the . . . ”

85630	85645	85589	85590	The giant	2607	“ Oh , that happens all the time . It ’s a simple fix . ”

87117	87180	87112	87112	Charon	248	“ I do n’t suppose you have coins for passage . Normally , with adults , you see , I could charge your American Express , or add the ferry price to your last cable bill . But with children . . . alas , you never die prepared . Suppose you ’ll have to take a seat for a few centuries . ”

87584	87648	87519	87519	Charon	248	“ Oh , you do n’t know the half of it . How would you like to babysit these spirits all day ? Always ‘ Please do n’t let me be dead ’ or ‘ Please let me across for free . ’ I have n’t had a pay raise in three thousand years . Do you imagine suits like this come cheap ? ”
87649	87654	87655	87655	I	0	“ You deserve better , ”

88933	89011	88897	88897	she	266	“ Yeah . Three judges . They switch around who sits on the bench . King Minos , Thomas Jefferson , Shakespeare — people like that . Sometimes they look at a life and decide that person needs a special reward — the Fields of Elysium . Sometimes they decide on punishment . But most people , well , they just lived . Nothing special , good or bad . So they go to the Asphodel Fields . ”

Had I not sent my Fury to discover you at Yancy Academy , Poseidon might have succeeded in hiding his scheme to start a war . But now you have been forced into the open . You will be exposed as Poseidon ’s thief , and I will have my helm back ! ”

95619	95682	95616	95616	Hades	310	“ Your pride makes you foolish , thinking you could bring such a weapon before me . I did not ask for Zeus ’s master bolt , but since it is here , you will yield it to me . I am sure it will make an excellent bargaining tool . And now . . . my helm . Where is it ? ”
95776	95782	95783	95783	I	0	“ Lord Hades , wait , ”

95971	96025	95966	95966	Hades	310	“ I took her . I knew , Percy Jackson , that you would come to bargain with me eventually . Return my helm , and perhaps I will let her go . She is not dead , you know . Not yet . But if you displease me , that will change . ”

98346	98349	98350	98350	Ares	294	“ Anyway , ”
98353	98408	98350	98350	Ares	294	“ I tinkered with the magic a bit , so the bolt would only return to the sheath once you reached the Underworld . You get close to Hades . . . . Bingo , you got mail . If you died along the way — no loss . I still had the weapon . ”
98409	98421	98422	98422	I	0	“ But why not just keep the master bolt for yourself ? ”

Zeus cast Kronos ’s remains into the darkest pit of Tartarus . The Titan army was scattered , their mountain fortress on Etna destroyed , their monstrous allies driven to the farthest corners of the earth . And yet Titans can not die , any more than we gods can . Whatever is left of Kronos is still alive in some hideous way , still conscious in his eternal pain , still hungering for power . ”

Then they threw me one quest , and when I came back , it was like , ‘ Okay , ride ’s over . Have a nice life . ’ ”

111645	111713	111615	111615	Luke	288	“ You ’re wrong . He showed me that my talents are being wasted . You know what my quest was two years ago , Percy ? My father , Hermes , wanted me to steal a golden apple from the Garden of the Hesperides and return it to Olympus . After all the training I ’d done , that was the best he could think up . ”

111782	111933	111723	111723	I	0	scar—“and when I came back , all I got was pity . I wanted to pull Olympus down stone by stone right then , but I bided my time . I began to dream of Kronos . He convinced me to steal something worthwhile , something no hero had ever had the courage to take . When we went on that winter - solstice field trip , while the other campers were asleep , I snuck into the throne room and took Zeus ’s master bolt right from his chair . Hades ’s helm of darkness , too . You would n’t believe how easy it was . The Olympians are so arrogant ; they never dreamed someone would dare steal from them . Their security is horrible . I was halfway across New Jersey before I heard the storms rumbling , and I knew they ’d discovered my theft . ”
111959	111971	111951	111951	I	0	“ So why did n’t you bring the items to Kronos ? ”
111977	112132	111972	111972	Luke	288	“ I . . . I got overconfident . Zeus sent out his sons and daughters to find the stolen bolt — Artemis , Apollo , my father , Hermes . But it was Ares who caught me . I could have beaten him , but I was n’t careful enough . He disarmed me , took the items of power , threatened to return them to Olympus and burn me alive . Then Kronos ’s voice came to me and told me what to say . I put the idea in Ares ’s head about a great war between the gods . I said all he had to do was hide the items away for a while and watch the others fight . Ares got a wicked gleam in his eyes . I knew he was hooked . He let me go , and I returned to Olympus before anyone noticed my absence . ”
112159	112230	112152	112152	he	288	“ Afterward , the Lord of the Titans . . . h - he punished me with nightmares . I swore not to fail again . Back at Camp Half - Blood , in my dreams , I was told that a second hero would arrive , one who could be tricked into taking the bolt and the helm the rest of the way — from Ares down to Tartarus . ”
112231	112243	112139	112139	He	288	“ You summoned the hellhound , that night in the forest . ”
112244	112284	112152	112152	he	288	“ We had to make Chiron think the camp was n’t safe for you , so he would start you on your quest . We had to confirm his fears that Hades was after you . And it worked . ”
